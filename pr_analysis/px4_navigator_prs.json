This results in the same behavior when switching into Hold/Loiter mode directly (either through RC switch or in the flight mode selection in QGC) or through the \"Hold\" button in QGC (which sends a DO_REPOSITION with the fields at the current position). \r\n\r\nIn this screen recording you see the behavior prior and after this PR.\r\nhttps://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/assets/26798987/9079b575-77fc-40a2-be54-b3c11816cca3\r\n\r\n### Changelog Entry\r\nFor release notes:\r\n```\r\nBugfix: Fixed-wing: Always establish loiter around current position when switching into Hold mode\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\nFix detection on whether we're currently on an established loiter, and in that case don't loiter around current position but keep established loiter.

Upon resuming the mission though, we have to re-configure gimbal and camera and start the triggering once back on the mission path.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nStore (cache) all gimbal/camera/trigger mission items and replay them on resuming the mission. In detail:\r\n- `on_inactivation() `store the currently active index as `_inactivation_index`\r\n- `on_activation()`, store all gimbal/camera/trigger items up to the currently active index and reset the mission to the previous. Also set flag (`_align_heading_necessary`) that a yaw alignment is required upon reaching this waypoint (we want to only start triggering once yaw is correctly aligned with next WP).\r\n- `on_active()`\r\n  - if `_align_heading_necessary` is set and mission item is reached, update current item with yaw field and force it to accept that one before starting the trigger.\r\n  - read the gimbal and camera mode command items from cache, thus making the gimbal move to the right orientation and setting the right camera mode\r\n  - read the trigger commands once the previous waypoint incl. yaw alignment is accepted\r\n\r\nFurther:\r\n- reset cached items if mission is updated\r\n- reset mission on disarmed only if we reached the last mission item, otherwise keep\r\n\r\n### Changelog Entry\r\nFor release notes:\r\n```\r\nFeature: Improve mission resume (e.g. replay gimbal and camera commands of a survey)\r\nDocumentation: Need to clarify page\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\nIt would be nice to not resume the mission from the previous mission item but from the actual lat/lon position where the mission was interrupted. \r\n\r\n### Test coverage\r\nSITL tested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Previously, direct access to the Dataman module was used, where requests were inserted into the queue with a semaphore. This approach has now been replaced with the uORB messaging system.\r\n\r\nDatamanClient introduces both **synchronous** and **asynchronous** modes of communication with Dataman.\r\n\r\n**DatamanCache**\r\nThis class serves as a cache storage for a defined amount of Dataman items. Currently, the cache does not employ any advanced caching algorithms.\r\n\r\n**Integration within mission**\r\nThe mission now incorporates a simple caching mechanism that attempts to cache the next N items whenever the \"current item\" is modified. \r\nIn order to eliminate the need for a locking mechanism within the mission, logic has been implemented to check if the set of mission items has been updated in the Dataman. The write operation to DM_KEY_MISSION_STATE has been removed from the mavlink thread, and instead, the existing uORB (mission.msg) message is utilized.\r\n\r\n **Integration geofence and safe points**\r\nAs the information on new geofence and safe points is updated at the end, it is safe to utilize it without the need for a lock. Integration has been implemented to store all geofence and safe point items within the cache and update them whenever changes occur.\r\n\r\n**Overview of the new architecture**\r\n![image](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/assets/10188706/8fdcda1c-c64f-4e28-b03b-c52f6330c162)\r\n\r\n**Stack is increased as it was needed**\r\n![image](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/assets/10188706/65dd9daf-7440-4f1d-ac18-cdf2e7e1bc5e)\r\n",

Mid-mission flip to HOLD mode and issue a do_relocate. \r\nBefore the change: [log](https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=784a1777-8dff-446c-989e-8bf3cc0210ec)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16963678/229414814-126a9520-6e09-45c8-9e83-ca82b665525d.png)\r\n\r\nAfter the change: [log](https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=015494ff-ad95-498b-bfd3-b59632db3525)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16963678/229414936-f46b1814-8105-4f38-a5c5-cfbb1b980273.png)\r\n\r\n",

Geofence reposition lifetime: when in RTL, the geofence reposition setpoint is ignored (ok, fine) - however, the reposition struct that holds that geofence position is stored until the next flight.

External reposition commands without a requested mode switch (flag) are silently accepted and can cause unexpected positioning when hold is engaged.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n1.

Don't allow reposition commands without a requested mode switch.\r\n\r\n### Changelog Entry\r\nFor release notes:\r\n```\r\nBugfix: Don't allow external reposition commands without a mode switch, and ensure old reposition commands are not erroneously set.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\nReal solution is not sharing the reposition struct between multiple modes, and not reusing loiter mode for goto and hold.\r\n\r\n### Test coverage\r\n- used libmav to send a reposition command without the modeswitch bit.. it rejects now\r\n- test case:\r\n  - unplug manual control\r\n  - let the multicopter rtl with geo fence boundary set near home\r\n  - geo fence sets reposition struct somewhere along the path towards home (but rtl ignores)\r\n  - vehicle lands, disarms\r\n  - arm and takeoff again in manual\r\n  - unplug manual control\r\n  - rtl ensues\r\n  - the rtl hold delay before returning to home is correctly set to the vehicle's current position (not the previously set reposition struct from last flight)",

This warning was most likely added to protect the user from mistakes, but flying below the home altitude with a drone is not so uncommon and the warnings are therefore too excessive.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nThe check for the waypoint altitude being below home has been completely removed. \r\n\r\n### Changelog Entry\r\nFor release notes:\r\n```\r\nFeature: Don't print warnings for waypoints with altitudes below the home position\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\nWe could also limit to one warning per mission that contains waypoints below home, instead of one warning per waypoint.

Mission module per default assumed the mission was not valid when the mission uorb topic changed. Only when the mission counter is updated, it actually checks the validity of the mission. But since the mission topic gets updated as well when the geofence or safepoints changed, this would lead to wrongly failed missions in the mission module where the mission would be reset.\r\n2. The mission counter in mavlink_mission module was always set to 0 on startup. When on the last powercycle, exactly one mission was loaded, the mission counter in the dataman was set to one. On the next powerccle and the first mission upload, the mavlink_mission would report again a mission counter of 1. This would lead in the mission module to believe, that the mission was not updated at all.\r\n\r\nFixes #{Github issue ID}\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\n1. Mission module loads the previously calculated mission validity and if the mission changes, calculates it newly.\r\n2. mavlink_mission loads the mission counter on startup from the datamn (safepoints as well, already done for geofence).\r\n\r\n### Changelog Entry\r\nFor release notes:\r\n```\r\nBugfix: Mission failed on geofence/safepoint upload\r\nBufgix: Mission failed on first mission upload\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Test coverage\r\n- SITL test: checking the px4 console output.\r\n",

It is based on the earlier implementation for the mission checksum support in https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/18418, but the mission checksum in Mavlink will be deprecated in https://github.com/mavlink/mavlink/pull/2010.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n- Add an opaque Id for the mission, geofence and rally points. The opaque id is based on a Crc32 checksum as in the implementation in https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/18418\r\n- Opaque id is send from the System in the MISSION_COUNT on download. On upload, the opaque id is sent on the final MISSION_ACK\r\n- The opaque Id is also streamed continuously in the MISSION_CURRENT message, such that a GCS can detect plan changes.\r\n- The opaque id internally also replaces the mission counter, as those serves the same purpose.\r\n\r\n### Changelog Entry\r\nFor release notes:\r\n```\r\nFeature: Add Support for Mavlink mission opaque Id.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\nOpqaue id could also just be a counter instead of the Crc32. The hash implementation has the advantage that on loading the same mission (e.g. also from a file) should result in the same Id and thus the potentially multiple connected GCS does not need to download it again. Also it would allow for the feature, that a GCS does not need to download the mission on first connection if the old stored mission and opaque id is the same.\r\n\r\n### Test coverage\r\n- Unit/integration test: SITL testing by observing the mavlink message sent from the system.\r\n\r\n### Context\r\n- Before this can be merged, the respective mavlink PR should be merged\r\n",

For the mission in RAM the memory for the maximum mission/geofence/rally points is already reserved, so there wont be any additional memory cost there (and that is the reason for the difference between this PR and main, since we need to reserve double the storage in memory for geofence and rally points). When the mission is written on the SDcard, the dataman module does not need more memory depending on the mission. The only thing that is taking currently more memory when you upload bigger geofences and rally points is that the geofence and RTL mode cache all the points in memory (mission only caches the next 10 points irrespecitve of length). But that is the same both for the PR and main. So the memory difference is still the same.",

This should be used if waypoints have an associated yaw setpoint (eg landings, VTOL transitions or waypoint mission items with the yaw field set). Otherwise leave authority over yaw to the FlightTask - it can then set it e.g. to direction of the next waypoint, to current yaw, or point the vehicle into the wind with the use of weather vane. \r\n\r\nThat allows us to remove the `disable_weather_vane` field from the position_setpoint.\r\n\r\nAdditionally I propose to thin out the position_setpoint topic and remove unnecessary fields: \r\n- `yaw_valid` (yaw is declared valid when `yaw` field is finite) --> we should init the yaw field to NAN ideally\r\n- `yawspeed` (doesn't seem to be used)\r\n- `yawspeed_valid`\r\n\r\nThere's also some other small cleanup proposal, check commits. \r\n\r\n### Changelog Entry\r\nFor release notes:\r\n```\r\nBugfix: FlightTaskAuto: disable wather vane if position setpoint contains yaw setpoint.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\n\r\n\r\n### Test coverage\r\nSITL tested for MC and VTOL. \r\nMC test:\r\n- Start the windy gazebo environment: `make px4_sitl gazebo_iris__windy`\r\n- Enable parameter `WV_EN`\r\n- Takeoff and RTL --> on current main it is stuck, doesn't RTL. With the fix here sets the yaw to the home_position.yaw, disables weather vane because the yaw field is finite, aligns yaw and descends. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Context\r\nWe should remove the yaw field of the Takeoff mission item in QGC, it has no effect (already previously to this PR).  Conceptionally I don't see the need of a yaw attribute to a MC takeoff, and wouldn't know what to expect (yaw once takeoff altitude achieved? Or already when climbing?)\r\n![image](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/assets/26798987/971572b0-f998-42fd-9547-192d3e4d8b69)\r\n\r\n",

I did have one thought regarding this solution:\r\n\r\nIf weather vane is disabled when a finite yaw setpoint is given, it will always be disabled during RTL, as there is currently always a yaw setpoint given. This may be a problem in the case of an asymetric airframe or a vehicle with a lifting surface, where it may be desirable to point into the direction of the wind the entire time. A parameter to not provide a yaw setpoint (enable weather vane) during RTL might be useful in some use cases. Hope this makes sence.",

Your solution runs it drectly on upload which is preferable, but then you should reflect this evaluation in the mission result uorb topic as its done here https://github.com/Drone-Lab/PX4-Autopilot/blob/5490f8913bd26ac04d59908271ce9c5e6a1bd414/src/modules/navigator/mission_base.cpp#L702-L707 such that it is not run again by the mission feasibility checker. The problem is then, that if e.g. the home position is changed, it is still not run again, up until the mission is started. Also now, it is checked once the geofence is uploaded and once the mission is uploaded, which means if you upload a new mission with new geofence, it is evaluated once on outdated data, depending which one is uploaded first.\r\n\r\nI also already have though about how to do the checking properly, but the above problem makes it difficult. i think that QGC always send the mission, geofence, and rally points, irrespective of what you have actually changed. But with mavlink in general you should be able to send only what you actually have changed. Also if you change both and upload them, you would preferably run the check only once after both are uploaded, else you would do the evaluation on outdated data. But there is currently no way of knowing if another upload is pending except maybe waiting for a short amount of time and checking if another mission upload is in progress. Maybe there is also something mission in MAVLINK itself to solve this.\r\n\r\n",

The mission feasibility checker makes the opposite, it defines the mission as invalid and wont let you execute the mission.

When the ground control station upload mission or geofence to the drone.In geofence.cpp, there is a state machine designed to read geofence data from ourb and load it onto the drone, as illustrated in the following picture.\r\n   <p align=\"center\">\r\n     <img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/151698793/294857321-53c6d894-448a-4130-85ae-30ab7e12e171.png\" width=\"622\" />\r\n   </p>\r\n   This functionality is called within a while(1) loop in navigator_main.cpp.\r\n\r\n   https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/cf840ff3731d8bebf65e79bd8c9c7bbd8d29d404/src/modules/navigator/navigator_main.cpp#L893  \r\nThe read and load operations within it utilize **asynchronous** reading, ensuring that they do not block the function loop.\r\nhttps://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/cf840ff3731d8bebf65e79bd8c9c7bbd8d29d404/src/modules/navigator/geofence.cpp#L111-L112\r\nhttps://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/cf840ff3731d8bebf65e79bd8c9c7bbd8d29d404/src/modules/navigator/geofence.cpp#L155-L163\r\n \r\n2. When the ground control station upload mission or geofence to the drone.In mission_feasibility_checker.cpp, **synchronous** reading is employed to retrieve updates for the mission, and to check for potential conflicts between the mission and geofence.\r\nhttps://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/20129e63facab129ad31fa693d1397e7458afaa4/src/modules/navigator/mission_feasibility_checker.cpp#L122-L123\r\nThis functionality is called within a while(1) loop in navigator_main.cpp too.\r\nhttps://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/20129e63facab129ad31fa693d1397e7458afaa4/src/modules/navigator/navigator_main.cpp#L873-L877\r\n\r\n3. This is the cause of the issue. When on the ground control station, both the geofence and mission are updated simultaneously. The geofence undergoes multiple state transitions through the state machine (with each state transition requiring the execution of a while(1) loop), and it is only after asynchronous reading that the geofence data can be loaded for the mission_feasibility_checker to examine.\r\nTherefore, when the mission_feasibility_checker utilizes synchronous reading to obtain mission data, the geofence data involved in the check has not yet been updated. Consequently, the check is performed with outdated geofence data, resulting in the failure of the checker.",

I know that this function is executed as soon as a mission is uploaded, and thus it could be that a geofence upload is in progress and the mission is not checked with the right geofence, which would result in a wrong evaluation. However, it is checked again before the mission is executed and a geofence violation is caught at that time (though you don't have immediate feedback in QGC). Also to not have a data race by writing and reading to the fence on the same time, there is another PR to add double geofence storage here: https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/22533. I think the way to go would be to decouple the mission feasibility checker from the mission and run the checks if the home position, geofence, or mission changed, and there is no mavlink mission upload in progress. As a short term fix i would suggest changing the order in which QGC is uploading the mission and make sure that the geofence are uploaded before the mission is uploaded. Further you could call check_mission_valid https://github.com/Drone-Lab/PX4-Autopilot/blob/5490f8913bd26ac04d59908271ce9c5e6a1bd414/src/modules/navigator/mission_base.cpp#L696 periodically as this checks if the geofence is changed since the last evaluation and runs it again.",

Currently, the geofence update only checks the origin and the current position associated with the geofence, and I've added a check for mission waypoints to make the check on upload more complete.The problem is related to the state machine and asynchronous message reading in geofence.cpp.The checkMissionAgainstGeofence() is written in the mission and the geofence is still being read when the mission has finished uploading and checking.\r\n \r\n![%`%3Z`6)VGYLVSF_)N0L{BT](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/assets/151698793/38b3fe89-4ed8-47d7-8822-c5254984f679)\r\n\r\n2. Regarding the issue of being unable to perform geofence breach checks for the home point using VEHICLE_CMD_DO_SET_HOME in commander.cpp due to geofence not being available in the navigator, the following solution is proposed:**When the drone switches to RTL mode, check whether the home point triggers a geofence breach.**\r\nHowever, at present, we only return the result and have successfully tested it. We have not yet implemented handling for the detected issues and event notifications because there may be some irregularities or issues in the code. We would appreciate your feedback on this matter.\r\n\r\nFixes #{#22362}\r\nIn this bug issue , @czbxzm said ,\"1. When swapping the order, uploading the mission waypoint routes first and then plotting the no-fly zones does not trigger any checks, even if there is an overlap between the two;\"Actually this check triggers, but requires a second click on upload.(in the version reporting this bug issue)\r\n\r\n#｛#22373｝\r\nIn this bug issue, @BladeY1 said,\"In SITL simulation, we observed that the Home point can be arbitrarily set by the operator. Since Return to Launch (RTL) navigates the drone back to the Home point, inadvertent placement of the Home point within a no-fly zone can result in the drone breaching no-fly zone checks or entering the restricted area when the operator manually selects RTL. We validated this behavior using a drone equipped with PX4 flight control. It indeed demonstrated the ability to enter a no-fly zone through the aforementioned actions.We believe that operators typically intend to avoid their drones entering no-fly zones to prevent potential damage or safety incidents. No-fly zones, often manually designated by operators, are crucial in areas like airports, amusement parks with high-altitude ride systems, or locations with dense obstacles such as forests, lakes, and clusters of buildings.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\n1.

Using `position_setpoint.disable_weather_vane` for landing purposes works well in this scenario.

If you don’t then the turn will be limited to the safe limit, but it will always allow a bank of at least 25 degrees (to ensure you can still maneuver if your airspeed estimate is badly off).\n\nWe've seen this technique in other two more simpler controllers and it works.\n\n> when in auto-throttle modes the autopilot will also raise the minimum airspeed in the TECS system to the level at which the current demanded bank angle can be safely achieved. So it will add more engine power or lower the nose to raise the airspeed so that the bank angle that the navigation controller is demanding can be achieved without a stall\n\nThey use these two parameters:\n\n> The **STALL_PREVENTION** parameter. If this is set to zero then no stall prevention is done. This may be useful if you have no airspeed sensor and the synthetic airspeed estimate is not good \n> enough\n> \n> The **ARSPD_FBW_MIN** parameter, which is the configured minimum airspeed for level flight. It is this value that is scaled with the bank angle to calculate the safe airspeed for any demanded bank angle\n\nI'm not saying we have to copy, but there is not a big choice of approaches toward stall. It is classical physics.  \n",

I did it by setting the target's position as the waypoints for the 'follower' (also I think I overwrote the current target waypoint with the latest waypoint I received from the target. Otherwise, the follower's position oscillated heavily). \nThis strategy 'works' but you end up with steady state error between the target(say, moving in a straight line) and the follower (who never got directly in line behind the target, was always a bit to the left or the right). This can be seen in the following pic:\n\n![dsc_0615](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3105122/13201714/9179428e-d87d-11e5-9f86-2a6d8ccab171.JPG)\n\nYou can see the green plane (fixed wing UAV) is following not directly behind the leader, but to the side. This was because unlike a single static waypoint, the waypoints in this case were constantly overwritten to the new target position values, with the controller never getting the time to correct the steady state error. This made me feel that, atleast for fixedwings, tracking moving targets required something more than just setting moving waypoints from the controls point of view.\n\nYou can see a mission with 3 aircrafts daisy-chained here:\n![3-ac-lf-2013-09-28 13_41_29](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3105122/13201743/7d2f5934-d87e-11e5-85f1-1635b420890e.png)\n",

Its about orienting the plane into the wind so that wind gusts do not completely ruin the position and attitude control response. Its very different from mixer limits.\n\nWe reserved a minimum for yaw. And it would put the motors at their maximum spread. It would mean that you would see the system constantly yaw in wind, coupled with roll and pitch. Two motors would run at their maximum capacity and overheat. We can't handle this on a best-effort basis in the mixer. We need to do this in the controller already, like Sander proposed.\n",

This means that now everyone using `sensor_combined` gets voted data, including ekf2. It also adds voting for the baro.\n- use relative timestamps, necessary for the new logger. Logging `sensor_combined` at full rate now only needs 18KB/s.\n- Memory savings: when using the `q` estimator, we get almost 2kB of additional RAM, with ekf2 it's roughly 0.6kB. This is because ekf2 did not do voting, and voting itself is quite heavy, it requires 1.5kB.\n\nThis introduces a lot of changes at central places, affecting all estimators. Nothing complex, but still, it needs careful review and testing all of the estimators.\n\nI still plan to break up the sensors class into several smaller classes to make things easier to maintain.\n",

I've had conversations with @priseborough in the past about concerns of gyro stability and EKF covariance tracking over long periods of straight and level flight.  There is a lack of \"system observability\" during straight and level flight which allows the gyros to wander without good correction from the accelerometers and other sensors measuring turns.  I know from experience with other systems  (non-px4, non-pixhawk) that this is a well understood concern in the world of kalman filtering.  So, this distance limit is driven as much by the quality of your hardware system (gryos usually) as it is the quality of your EKF and flight software.\r\n\r\nHaving said that we have slowly been increasing MIS_DIST_WPS on our fixed wing aircraft over the years, we make incremental and conservative increase a few hundred meters at a time, then spend months of testing, then eventually release to our users, then we increase again, test, release, repeat.  We are currently at 2500 meters for MIS_DIST_WPS using a FMUv4 based autopilot hardware.  No issues with 1000's of flights.\r\n\r\nIf 5000 meters is super well tested and understood then hooray!",

It then triggers a transition as soon as this waypoint is reached, which happens when the vehicle is within L1 distance to it. Is the L1 distance smaller then the needed space for the transition, then the vehicle overshoots. The current logic is that for a transition waypoint, the waypoint has to be reached again in the new VTOL mode (e.g. in hover after a backtransition). Thus, if it overshoots, it turns around to accept it, and only then proceeds to the next waypoint.\r\nI don't really get in which case this would be desired.\r\n\r\nThis can lead to ugly situations like this:\r\n![VTOLtransitionmaster](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26798987/103775614-98f76580-502e-11eb-95ef-b0b14f675bba.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe your solution**\r\nDo not make it accept the waypoint again in the new VTOL mode, but directly proceed to the next:\r\n![vtoltransition_withfixes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26798987/103775628-9e54b000-502e-11eb-860b-d1f55a596d98.png)\r\nThat means that if you don't have the previous, current and next waypoint in one line, it will make a turn while transitioning.

And in case it reaches the first FW WP while still in transition move towards the next one.\r\n\r\nI think both ways have advantages and drawbacks. In my dream world the drone can handle any type of turns during transition if needed. But I also see that if you ask for a harsh turn during transition it might not end well - even though so far what I saw looked quite stable in the air with the L1 tracking during transition.\r\n\r\nMy main concern with the \"stubborn\" heading hold is that if you have a tight geofence just flying straight no matter what might get you closer to the geofence than you'd like, e.g. with tail wind. Or also without geofence, if the drone has to do a full bank turn to backtrack just after transition it's not great either. Admittedly, in these cases you can also say badly planned mission.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand we'd have a more reliable planned trajectory if the front transition really tracks the planned WPs (as it now does with the back transition).

Reasoning: For backtransition it would immediately accept the waypoint, and that's required for making the back transition smoother (original goal of this PR). For front transition it wasn't an issue so far that it only got accepted once the transition was finished (this could change fast, I know).\r\n",

If not, I find the symmetric solution more elegant.\r\n\r\nThe way I understand the half a second waiting time is to make sure that `in_transition_mode` was updated so that you can monitor this until the transition is over, and not to make sure that the transition command is actually sent. But to me the recent changes in how transitions are done make it obsolete to wait until the end of the transition (for both ways) to accept the waypoint. It's just that I don't see the danger, but mayhaps that's just my lack of knowledge on some parts of PX4 code. If it helps to bring this PR in, then let's go with the asymmetric behaviour.",

This can lead to legal issues if the vehicle ends up outside of the expected area, safety issues if an obstacle is hit that the geofence was meant to avoid, and the vehicle can also be 'stuck' if the breach is continually triggered, overriding attempted user actions.\r\n\r\n**Describe your solution**\r\nPredict the motion of the vehicle and trigger the breach if it is determined that the current trajectory would result in a breach happening before the vehicle can make evasive maneuvers, if it delayed any longer. The vehicle is then re-routed to a safe hold position (stop for multirotor, loiter for fixed wing).\r\n\r\n**Describe possible alternatives**\r\nThere was also the idea of 'shrinking' the allowed flight area, however this would not be robust to different vehicle configurations or tuning.\r\n\r\n**Test data / coverage**\r\nExtensive testing both in SITL and on real vehicles (fixed wing, VTOL and multirotor) inside of Auterion.

In Commander, subscribe to this and trigger RTL if the current battery level less the battery used on RTL will take the vehicle below the existing low battery thresholds.\r\n\r\n**Describe possible alternatives**\r\nA parameter was used for \"total flight time in RTL\". This could have been taken from the power module / smart battery telemetry of the current and battery capacity values. However, for multirotor that is risky because power usage in forward flight is higher than hover, so a vehicle hovering far away would RTL too late. The parameter approach also lets users set a hard upper limit on the amount of time they would be happy with the vehicle spending in RTL, which might be useful for regulatory or safety reasons.\r\n\r\n**Test data / coverage**\r\nThis was tested extensively in Auterion, but I haven't tested it yet since upstreaming. It should get some SITL time to make sure nothing broke in the transplant, but the concept is quite solid.\r\n\r\nNote: it might be better to squash this on merge",

Is it supported in QGC - how?\r\n- How does this work? My guess is that you set low battery action to RTL. Then you set RTL_FLT_TIME to indicate max time expected for RTL. The low battery RTL will then trigger early based on the systems calculation that time taken to get home at cruise speed will trigger low battery RTL within RTL_FLT_TIME. Is that correct?

The behavior when a takeoff waypoint was passed to a rover vehicle was:\r\n- The vehicle would not move since the waypoint was too close\r\n- The takeoff waypoint would not get accepted since rovers are not able to climb and reach the altitude\r\n\r\nI think it might be obvious that one \"should not\" pass takeoff waypoints to a vehicle. However, QGroundControl only lets you plan a mission that starts with a takeoff waypoint. While this should also be an improvement on the QGC side, I think it is still useful to handle this case on the vehicle side so that the vehicle can still progress with the mission even with a takeoff waypoint\r\n\r\n**Describe your solution**\r\nThis adds a special case when handling takeoff waypoints for rover vehicles. The acceptance radius is set to only consider horizontal distance to the waypoint, if the vehicle type is rover.\r\n\r\n**Test data / coverage**\r\n- This was tested in SITL gazebo, with the rover model.\r\n```\r\nmake px4_sitl gazebo_rover\r\n```\r\nThis log shows a full mission successfully finished starting with a Takeoff waypoint and finished with a RTL: https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=25fe983b-44d0-4a11-a7c2-2ab9662c35d4\r\n",

      "body": "Hello!\n\nMy goal was to make the mission command DO_SET_SERVO working with the possibility of triggering the servo with RC switch.\n\nFirst, I have found that \"vmount\" module (when enabled) publishes its values to actuator_controls_2 topic all the time. This overwrites all other publications to this topic. That is why DO_SET_SERVO is not working.\n\nI modified \"vmount\" module so that it would publish only if one of the actuator values were changed by RC. In other cases it stays silent.\n\nSecond, I have found that the formula, which translates PWM value from DO_SET_SERVO command parameters to -1..1 range for uORB, does not match the one which translates it back.\n[Original formula:](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/c997159e32f3870c7fd3202877324b76a62ea610/src/modules/navigator/mission_block.cpp#L433) `actuators.control[(int)item.params[0]] = 1.0f / 2000 * -item.params[1];`\n[Formula, which translates value back](https://github.com/4ert/Firmware/blob/397522d3813924380c209984b47b05bf743c3037/src/lib/pwm_limit/pwm_limit.cpp#L211): `effective_pwm[i] = control_value * (max_pwm[i] - min_pwm[i]) / 2 + (max_pwm[i] + min_pwm[i]) / 2;`\n[New formula](https://github.com/4ert/Firmware/blob/397522d3813924380c209984b47b05bf743c3037/src/modules/navigator/mission_block.cpp#L440): `actuators.control[(int)item.params[0]] = (float)(((float)item.params[1] - (PWM_DEFAULT_MAX + PWM_DEFAULT_MIN) / 2)/((PWM_DEFAULT_MAX - PWM_DEFAULT_MIN) / 2));`\n\nI need to discuss two questions about the formula: \n- to make it work properly we need to get actual \"max_pwm[i]\" and \"min_pwm[i]\" into navigator module. I have found a [way to get them](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/c997159e32f3870c7fd3202877324b76a62ea610/src/drivers/px4fmu/fmu.cpp#L1678), but I don't understand how to use it correctly\n- when I tested mission with DO_SET_SERVO command, servo works nice only with 1, 3 and 4 aux outputs. The second one for some reason outputs into first. I think there is something wrong with casting here: `(int)item.params[0]`\n\nI have tested everything with 1.7.3 Firmvare (px4fmu-v2_default), but did not save the flight log.\nI will test the last master in a few days.",

The cargo is locked by the servo which is connected to one of the AUX outputs. We want to use DO_SET_SERVO command to send a PWM signal (parameter 2) to the AUX output from paramter 1.\r\n- **Which servo does it correspond to?**\r\n[As we can see now](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/bbc0c28c2c07743e489a338677e449a28ab5fd74/src/modules/navigator/mission_block.cpp#L436) the Navigator publish DO_SET_SERVO values to actuator_controls_2 topic. This control group is used to rule gimbal:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/161284/44657760-b18af600-aa06-11e8-9fd8-8a5971d51ffe.png)\r\n- **What's the real use case for DO_SET_SERVO? Would we be better implementing a couple higher level commands? payload, gripper, etc**\r\nI think when you use DO_SET_SERVO command - you just want to send an exactly PWM to external servo connected to your controller. If you want to rule gimbal - you will use DO_MOUNT_CONTROL, if you have any flight control mechanizm connected to the AUX - you will want to use some more convenient commands for this.\r\n- **If the answer is still DO_SET_SERVO then the right place to implement that command is in the px4io (MAIN pwm) and/or px4fmu (AUX pwm) drivers. Those drivers are the consumers of actuator_controls_{0, 1, 2, 3} and work directly with PWM values.**\r\nSo, I just made a little repair into an existing WORKING mechanizm. For now, Navigator module publishes into an \"actuator_controls_2\" topic and the px4fmu driver gets values from it and sends to the servos. There's just two things which discourage the process: the vmount driver spamming with its own values to the topic and the formula which translates data wrong. If you switch vmount off (\"vmount stop\" command into a console) and correct the formula - DO_SET_SERVO will work as expected. And don't forget to load a mixer for AUX outputs.\r\n\r\n- **What's supposed to happen in the not entirely unlikely scenario that that PWM channel is already used for something?**\r\nI think, this question is up to the one who builds and sets up the specific device. If you connects some critical stuff to the AUX - edit mixers or just don't use DO_SET_SERVO.",

          "body": "@dagar regarding https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/pull/10320#issuecomment-415903772 (your questions) there are some good points there. Below are \"in my opinion\". \r\n\r\n> Which servo does it correspond to? \r\n\r\nShouldn't this be defined at the MAVLink/message level by a convention? How about 1-n are the MAIN outputs as labeled on board, and n upwards are the AUX ports, if present? \r\n\r\n> What's supposed to happen in the not entirely unlikely scenario that that PWM channel is already used for something?\r\n\r\nIMO things screw up - it is up to the user of this tool to manage contention. See real use case below. \r\n\r\nDo we actually manage contention otherwise? ie does the system check that we don't have multiple control group inputs assigned to the same output?\r\n\r\n> What's the real use case for DO_SET_SERVO? \r\n\r\nThe real use case is probably the hardware we haven't thought about. Someone has some magic hardware that they want to drive, and a free port. They just want to be able to plug in that hardware and send it a command via MAVLink. They don't want to care about mixers. They are happy to manage contention themselves -  ie they know that nothing else is connected to the port, and if they screw up they screw up.\r\n\r\n> Would we be better implementing a couple higher level commands? payload, gripper, etc\r\n\r\nWe currently have [First Payload](http://dev.px4.io/en/concept/mixing.html#control-group-6-first-payload) which is just a parachute. Yes we should probably define something for a gripper. Not sure it will address the above use case.\r\n\r\nI've read http://dev.px4.io/en/concept/mixing.html and I am not 100% confident that my understanding of how these work is complete. I think that control groups are implemented as UORB topics that something can set (ie a controller). A mixer defines what actuators are set and their values based on these inputs. \r\n\r\nSo essentially you create a control group so that you can arbitrarily map a specific **type** of command to a physical output. For example to use a parachute you write a handler for it in MAVLink that sets the appropriate control group UORB topic. \"Something\" in the architecture then takes the mapping in the mixer file and based on that topic input sets the appropriate PWM output. Is that about right?\r\n\r\nThis is good because your system does not need to know what plugs into the output to implement a parachute or gripper (say). But it does mean that you need a mixer.\r\n\r\nQuestion: Are mixer's additive? Ie I have an airframe which uses the main outputs. I add a parachute. Do I need a completely new mixer file, or can I add my mixer just for my parachute?\r\n\r\nYou could implement this as a servo control group(s). But would be better if the mapping was transparent (ie no specific mixer required). \r\n",

This is extremely bad, the vehicle just beelines towards `home.lat`, `home.lon`, and `home.alt`.\n\nThis wasn't a problem previously when we were using the `mc_pos_controller` for all the control, as previously the logic for `SETPOINT_TYPE_LAND` within `mc_pos_controller` would just set the lat/lon setpoints to NaN, which then caused the controller to default those setpoints to the current gpos.lat/gpos.lon and just land where it is at. \n\nI hope this didn't impact anyone other than ourselves.

We have seen many times the vehicle takeoff back into the air (RTL) when it is about to touch down for landing.\n\n**Describe your preferred solution**\nDo not allow RTL to `CLIMB` if already `position_setpoint_s::SETPOINT_TYPE_LAND`\n\n_I also cleaned up the comments, removed unnecessary includes, and got rid of namepacing_",

      "body": "**Issue**\r\nNavigator's fixed-wing first-order altitude hold (FOH) is currently causing altitude reference oscillations when in any LOITER mode. See screenshot below. Not only altitude, but also pitch and throttle can thus oscillate significantly. We observed this during a recent test flight.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2565608/42387985-53c6343e-8144-11e8-86d2-a42aecc4c5c0.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nLog file from SITL where this can be seen: https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=f18c45ab-622e-4b1d-9819-03cfb06af2b5 . Here, after t=3:20 the true altitude setpoint is still the same as before t=2:20 (i.e. 630m AMSL) but the FOH logic just wrongly sets it to 660m and adds slight oscillations on top. The exact amount of oscillations depends on waypoint distance, altitude difference etc, but i have seen altitude ref oscillations of up to 30m, resulting in full pitch up/down of the aircraft.\r\n\r\n**Analysis**\r\nSee the commit for the location of the code where this is happening. Essentially, every time that the loiter radius of any loiter WP is larger than the acceptance radius calculated from the L1 turn distance, then the Navigator FOH would _not_ consider the waypoint reached and would thus not stop modifying the current altitude setpoint. This leads to the oscillations or offsets in the altitude reference. \r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\nIf in any loiter mode, consider the loiter radius times a factor of 1.2 (same as for the waypoint_reached logic [here](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/src/modules/navigator/mission_block.cpp#L217) as the acceptance radius. Tested in SITL, which should be sufficient for this case.\r\n\r\n@acfloria @ryanjAA @antiheavy FYI\r\n@dagar Made this PR as a quick hotfix independently of your PR at https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/pull/8883/files which supposedly also fixes this but is much larger and where it is more uncertain when this would be merged.",

Some digging showed that this only happens when the `MAV_CMD` used to send the mission is in INT mode. The reason is the conversion  from `mavlink_mission` to `mission_item`. In INT mode the latitude and longitude need scaling:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/bb8e653469e67afb43dbb9ecf3899cf50ef6162f/src/modules/mavlink/mavlink_mission.cpp#L1282-L1294\r\n\r\nHowever, further down when setting the ROI parameters for LAT/LONG/ALT, the conversion is missing and the values are simply copied (cast) regardless of `_int_mode`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/bb8e653469e67afb43dbb9ecf3899cf50ef6162f/src/modules/mavlink/mavlink_mission.cpp#L1355-L1363\r\n\r\nA proposed fix is in the first commit.\r\n\r\n### Reproducing the issue:\r\nThe bug occurs only when the vehicle already has a mission loaded, with is removed in QGC, and then a new mission is sent containing the ROI. I am not sure why in one case INT mode is used, and in another case it's not...\r\n\r\n## ROI waypoint floating-point precision\r\nLooking at the situation with @MaEtUgR and @julianoes, we noticed that some precision is lost when using the parameter fields (float) of the vehicle message to store/access the ROI latitude and longitude (param 5 and param6):\r\nhttps://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/bb8e653469e67afb43dbb9ecf3899cf50ef6162f/src/modules/navigator/mission_block.cpp#L445-L463\r\n\r\nInstead, we can just as well use the mission item's latitude and longitude, which are `double`s instead of `float`s:\r\nhttps://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/bb8e653469e67afb43dbb9ecf3899cf50ef6162f/src/modules/navigator/navigation.h#L135-L153\r\n\r\nThe proposed fix is in the second commit, making the other commit redundant. \r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n@julianoes Please take a look :)",

Vehicle will return to LAT/LON location where the _Land_ command was issued and begin descending from there. In the future, I want to implement a **_BRAKE_** setpoint type, but this is a good fix until that work is done.\n\n2.

    "conversation": {
      "author": "philipoe",
      "body": "Fixed-wing autoland seems quite suboptimal at the moment. We have had very mixed results during flight tests so far, i.e. while on small foamy-like platforms or when landing on huge runways you may not have any issues, on short-field landings with larger and more complex (e.g. different flap configurations, wide airspeed range) platforms in challenging environments you will definitely see the shortcomings of the current autoland. This PR therefore introduces some improvements:\n\n### Improvements\n\n1. **Airplane landing configuration activated during loiter down (commit 2448863)**\n_Issue_: The landing configuration (i.e. setting the flaps and changing the airspeed from nominal to landing speed) was previously performed only when entering the final approach, i.e. at relatively low altitude above ground (15m is a good rule). In our flight tests, the flap and airspeed changes caused huge altitude errors (+5m), and the aircraft corrected by pitching down significantly and nearly slamming into the ground (alos because the integrators can wind up). This is extremely unsafe. _Solution_: The mode change (flaps, airspeed) is now performed when approaching the loiter-down WP, i.e. usually at much higher altitude of 50m+. The discontinuity is of course still there, but it happens at an altitude where it is safe and the controller (especially the integrators) still have plenty of time to adapt to this new configuration.\n\n2. **Separate and tigther gains for landing (commit 2448863)**\n_Issue_: To avoid motor wear and to allow a good flight efficiency, one usually wants to somewhat relax the TECS throttle time constant (FW_T_THRO_CONST). However, the alt/airspeed control may then not accurate enough for landings anymore. _Solution_: Introduced a throttle time constant scaling factor which is ONLY activated during landings (and loiter-down-to-landing) and is 100% by default such that it doesnt make a difference by default. Note that I am still debating a bit whether we should introduce even more landing-specific parameters (for example, the pitch setpoint offset FW_PSP_OFF changes quite a lot with flaps on our platform), but tried to reduce the amount of additional parameters in this PR. Any thoughts on that?\n\n3. **Tighter altitude acceptance radius for landings (commit https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/commit/d8cc40c67c521ef35cf74d41ee28b7adb8fe0c11)**\n_Issue_: Currently, the final decision on whether to enter the landing approch or not uses the standard altitude acceptance radius parameter for fixed wings (see [here](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/src/modules/navigator/mission_block.cpp#L255). This parameter is 10m by default, and we often set it to 20m because at higher altitudes it just does not matter. This is however not accurate enough for autolandings: Imagine you want to enter the landing approach at hAGL=15m, then the plane would still initiate the autoland at hAGL=5m...25m. Very unsafe and potentially not even feasible for the plane due to sink/climb rate constraints! _Solution_: A \"relative\" altitude acceptance radius, i.e. we assume a 30% error w.r.t. the remaining altitude difference to the landing waypoint can still be handled by the plane. Assuming hLandingApproach=15m, this means 4.5m of altitude acceptance radius. We of course constrain the altitude acceptance radius (see code).\n\n4. **ALWAYS flare when close to the ground (commit https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/commit/02e380af538ea8ef80a433da8fa63f63ed7601fb)**\n_Issue_: During previous flight testing, we were surprised to _sometimes_ see nice flares from the aircraft and sometimes not (i.e. the aircraft just impacted the ground with nominal sink speed of 0.5-0.8m/s). We always thought it is a tuning issue, but turns out it is also because the airplane _only_ flares when it is horizontally close enough to the landing waypoint. This can a) mean that the aircraft (e.g. simply due to errors in the altitude control) never really flares or b) that it will always flare at different altitudes AGL, so the impact velocity is always different. _Solution_: ALWAYS flare when close to the ground, thus guaranteeing a smooth landing in all cases. Note that the motor still _only_ shuts off when we are close to the land WP such that, e.g. if a downdraft pushed the aircraft too close to the ground, the aircraft still continues to fight that downdraft using the motor.\n\n### Notes\n - These are simple effective fixes that make autoland better without changing its overall structure. I know it can be improved a lot, but I think implementing these improvements as a first-shot solution is very important.\n - This was discussed with @dagar already. @priseborough @tstastny @LorenzMeier I am looking for feedback on why the changes I propose would NOT be suitable/better than the current implementation (or what could be improved quickly and effectively without changing the overall code too much)\n - Tested extensively in HIL already, i.e. that all mode changes and parameter changes work. The final tests (both HIL + flight testing) will be performed after feedback from you guys and the respective code changes.",

For example, people often manually plan a box-type landing pattern with traditional downwind, base, and final approach segments, they might place additional waypoints along the way to control the altitude, and place a DoLandStart command and the front of this to define it as the landing pattern in the mission. \r\n\r\nAlternate approaches to the \"integrators fighting flaps problem\" might include:\r\n- a slew rate parameter to slow down flap deployment allowing time for the integrators to adjust, this has the added benefit of allowing the roll integrator time to adjust to inadvertent differential flap deployment rates too.\r\n- a feed-forward type parameter for the pitch offset similar to what you mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> Separate and tigther gains for landing\r\n\r\nYes!  I think something along these lines would be of great benefit to manage landing energy.  Might also consider some soft of pitch gain and maybe roll gain scaling. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> Tighter altitude acceptance radius for landings\r\n\r\nI like the goal here, but I have concerns on the implementation.\r\n\r\nDo I correctly understand that the hard coded 30% value will be constrained to not exceed NAV_FW_ALT_RAD?

This could be very bad in the case where someone has placed a waypoint to start the final descent at low altitude very close to the Land waypoint (below trees, etc).  I see that you hard coded a 3m minimum, but even that is very difficult for most fixed wings to actually achieve.

Answers to some remaining questions below.\r\n\r\n>>Airplane landing configuration activated during loiter down\r\n\r\n>I couldn't tell how this works from your code link. My concern is how are you handling generic landing pattern use cases beyond the QGC built in landing pattern? For example, people often manually plan a box-type landing pattern with traditional downwind, base, and final approach segments, they might place additional waypoints along the way to control the altitude, and place a DoLandStart command and the front of this to define it as the landing pattern in the mission.\r\n\r\nGeneric landing patterns which do NOT involve a LOITER_TO_ALT waypoint before the final approach are handled exactly as before. So they still work, but do not profit from improvement 1 (like activating flaps + different airspeed earlier) in this PR. Two potential solutions:\r\n\r\n1. Just check whether the next_wp is a NAV_LAND WP independently of whether the curr_wp is a LOITER_TO_ALT WP. I am a bit concerned about cases like curr_wp=takeoff and next_wp=land however. So one would need to really carefully look for potentially dangerous corner cases.\r\n2. Alternatively, one could use the DO_LAND_START mission item to trigger the landing configuration. However, this is a mission item that is only known to NAVIGATOR (as far as i know), so we cannot handle this in the FixedWingPositionControl. And even _if_ we had the DO_LAND_START information where we need it, the question is still: What happens if a user forgets to set a DO_LAND_START mission item -> The same as if he does not use the LOITER_TO_ALT waypoint, i.e. the landing is still going to work but is not going to benefit from the improvements above.\r\n\r\n_General note:_ I really feel like a loiter-to-alt is _the_ waypoint type to use before an approach because it guarantees that _both_ your altitude _and_ heading are perfectly (within the acceptance tolerances of course) aligned with the landing approach. We also used the \"downwind, base...\" approaches before but always placed a loiter-to-alt (just a semi-circle, which does not even need to involve altitude changes btw.) directly before the landing approach because of the advantages mentioned above. \r\n\r\n>Alternate approaches to the \"integrators fighting flaps problem\" might include: a slew rate parameter to slow down flap deployment allowing time for the integrators to adjust, this has the added benefit of allowing the roll integrator time to adjust to inadvertent differential flap deployment rates too.\r\n\r\nDepends. If you start flap deployment at the same time as before (i.e. when entering the landing approach) but just deploy the flaps slower, then this is actually worse because you are shifting the time when the flaps are fully deployed even closer to the ground. So doing these configuration changes as early as possible is the way to go (unless you have a model-predictive controller or similar feed forwards).\r\n\r\n\r\n>>Tighter altitude acceptance radius for landings\r\n\r\n>I like the goal here, but I have concerns on the implementation. Do I correctly understand that the hard coded 30% value will be constrained to not exceed NAV_FW_ALT_RAD? I think it is important that the hard coded 30% value doesn't inadvertently exceed the normal waypoint acceptance distances.\r\n\r\nCorrect.\r\n\r\n> My bigger concern here is what is the behavior if the altitude is missed? does the vehicle do a turn-around to try to get back to the waypoint? This could be very bad in the case where someone has placed a waypoint to start the final descent at low altitude very close to the Land waypoint (below trees, etc). I see that you hard coded a 3m minimum, but even that is very difficult for most fixed wings to actually achieve. I'm not sure the right answer here, but maybe instead of hard coding 30% there should be a separate parameter for landing approach WP vertical error, different from NAV_FW_ALT_RAD?\r\n\r\nWith the QGC fixed-wing landing pattern (or a manually-set loiter-to-alt WP) the vehicle just does one other turn in the loiter circle. This is perfectly safe. For a standard waypoint, the airplane may turn back to track that WP, yes. But again, standard WPs don't seem optimal for me there: If you don't hit the altitude acceptance, then the airplane will do crazy stuff, so you have to set a large NAV_FW_ALT_RAD to avoid this -> This then however means that the landing approach altitude is potentially very inaccurate, which is again unsafe. So it's _only_ a tradeoff between two potentially dangerous situations! The much cleaner way is to use loiter-to-alt WPs. Still, i could of course also live with using an additional landing-altitude-acceptance-radius parameter (the disadvantage there concerns the _scale_ of your problem: So say for a landing approach from 15m AGL a 5m altitude acceptance radius might be fine, but if you then land from 100m AGL then 5m altitude acceptance radius is overly tight because your vehicle could easily compensate for say up to 30m altitude error during the landing approach -> This is exactly the reason for using the 30% relative acceptance altitude). Maybe @dagar can comment on what general Pixhawk fixed-wing users would prefer?\r\n\r\n>>ALWAYS flare when close to the ground\r\n\r\n> I agree we should get rid of the distance from land waypoint thing for Flare. However, I'm unsure about the throttle piece you've added. There is already a FW_LND_TLALT parameter which I feel should be respected no matter what (e.g. we don't want throttle kicking in when very close to the ground in case of propeller strike, etc).\r\n\r\nI did not change the throttle behavior at all! The limitation that throttle is NOT being cut off by the autoland logic when we are too far way from the waypoint was already there before, and i somewhat understand the reason for having it there: Of course, there is a certain risk of a propeller strike close to the ground, but if you deactivate that throttle too early you might not only loose your propeller but your whole plane. There is the tradeoff again ;) Note that the land-detector will shut down the throttle _after_ landing, so at least that is somewhat safe.",

This can of course be changed. But where do you see the advantage of using standard WPs instead of loiter-to-alt WPs (or: The QGC standard fixed-wing landing pattern)?

You are also saying you would need throttle to keep your airspeed when the airbrakes are out due to the drag, but the great thing in the loiter-to-alt (=down) mode is that you don't even need throttle but will keep your airspeed because you are descending anyways (and the sink rate can be configured of course).

Slowing down in a straight line with even the hint of a stall is easily managed by tecs and pitch but the concern is not the code to increase speed, that works great, it's that when you're creating so much more drag, the true ability to quickly increase speed is diminished and you are close to the ground. Recovering is potentially not an option at that point. As for why to separate the flaps, because anything that forces on flaps and in many cases airbrakes as well is not ideal. I wouldn't deploy airbrakes ever until I have exited my loiter tangent to the landing waypoint. \r\n\r\nLanding sequence is pretty standard, fixed wing pattern then once exited flaps and airbrakes come on and we see nose up for a moment if pitch correction isnt set and then glide down. This is more about forcing one action actually forces two (flaps and airbrakes) and anything to hinder the ability to stay in the air is a concern and when that limit is power overhead which we are reduced due to increased drag essentially just limits what can be flown in safely or in edge cases if can even be used at all. The more I think about it the more it makes me think that the power system needs to be able to easily overcome drag forces but also raises the questions of what do having airbrakes out do aerodynamically when trying to bank which would be a concern since ailerons will already be deployed.

So to enable landing gear operation in stabilized mode I had to follow the same pattern.\r\n\r\nFor the landing gear this might actually make a lot of sense because in the future the execution of the landing gear message should not be in the attitude controller anymore. And for the attitude I discussed with @Stifael it would make sense that the position controller sends thrust and yaw while the attitude controller converts either the input from the position controller or from the sticks to an attitude setpoint (quaterion) executes and publishes it for logging.",

I see 2 problems:\r\n- The FlightTaskAuto contains states and resets certain attributes when switching (https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/src/lib/FlightTasks/tasks/Auto/FlightTaskAuto.cpp#L468). In case of the reposition, the switches were random due to numerical inaccuracies. If possible we should avoid these states.\r\n- FlightTaskAutoLine uses _target and _prev_wp to determine the velocity direction (https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/src/lib/FlightTasks/tasks/AutoLine/FlightTaskAutoLine.cpp#L79). However this might not reflect where the vehicle currently is (I guess the states are meant to prevent this, but it doesn't seem to work).\r\n\r\nThe combination of all these led to the unexpected behavior.\r\n\r\nFixes #10757\r\n",

I have not looked into that yet.\n\n### Implementation\n- the general structure of the logger is the same, but the mission logs use a separate independent write buffer.\n- optimization to reduce the header size: now only the message formats are written for messages that are actually logged. Reduces the header size by about 13KB for a normal log.\n- due to other optimizations, RAM usage does not increase if the mission log is disabled.\n  If enabled, only the additional buffer of 300 bytes is required.\n\n### Testing\nI ran a stress-test on a low-quality SD card for 1h:30min with 90KB/s normal logging rate and enabled mission log with 5Hz camera capture publication. There were no drops for the mission log, and the maximum used buffer was 200 bytes, so 300 bytes buffer size will be enough.\nCPU load minimally increased from 5.6% + 1.7% to 5.7% + 1.8% for the main and writer threads.\n\nFixes https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/issues/10189.\n\nI enabled the mission log by default so that we get it field-tested.

Yeah, the check is not rerun on parameters change that is why the commander thinks the mission is feasible and switches to the mission. On mission activation however, the check is performed again, and thus, at this point it know that it is infeasible and shuts down again. I think we should address this later when we properly fix/refactor the check. I will only make a small change to make sure that the mission is rechecked on activation (currently depending on timing, you could change the parameter such that the mission is infeasible and still fly the mission). @sfuhrer for visibility",

When the drone is executing a mission, PX4 calculates the distance between the drone and the current target waypoint, and checks if it has reached the vicinity.\r\n\r\n   Here calculates the distance.\r\nhttps://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/8b96cd5372c343ef2a3f8a8b805d5b39b47a8008/src/modules/navigator/mission_block.cpp#L197-L201\r\n   When mission altitude mode is **Relative to Launch** `mission_item_altitude_amsl=mission_item.altitude + home_alt`\r\n\r\n   And here checks whether it is less than the acceptable radius.\r\nhttps://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/8b96cd5372c343ef2a3f8a8b805d5b39b47a8008/src/modules/navigator/mission_block.cpp#L394-L396\r\n\r\n2. When the drone is executing a mission, if the user modifies the home point to a new location (with a different altitude), the value of 'dist' will immediately change based on the new home point's altitude (which determines the check for whether the drone has reached the waypoint). However, the current actual executed 'mission_item' does not get updated.\r\n\r\n   This will result in a discrepancy between the actual executed target of the drone and the checked completion target, causing the drone to start randomly oscillating near the waypoint.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/assets/151698793/59782bec-8394-4621-9250-27d0e4ec038e)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Verification\r\n\r\nWe added some debug output to watch the drone's state change,and found every time the user changes the home point, 'dist_z' (altitude) also changes accordingly, but the 'mission_item' does not.\r\n\r\n### Temporary Patch\r\n\r\nThere are currently two patching approaches based on the expectations for how the drone should operate after modifying the home point: \r\n1. After changing the drone's home point altitude, the currently executed mission target should also change immediately \r\n2. Once the mission is uploaded and completed, the 'mission_item' should no longer change, even if the home altitude changes; the waypoint altitude should remain relative to the altitude at the time of mission upload\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n- This vulnerability could be exploited by attackers for covert attacks\r\n- When a benign user modifies the home point while the drone is executing a mission, the drone may oscillate, come into contact with surrounding obstacles, and ultimately crash\r\n- Modifying the home point to a new location during the mission execution will result in the drone randomly drifting near the next waypoint. This could lead to collisions and crashes.https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/22576\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/assets/151698793/273dd910-c92e-4817-8385-45c7ad38c3f8\r\n\r\nSome bugs prevent you from directly viewing the video.You can **download** and check this vedio.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/assets/151698793/41d03721-bdd4-4e6d-a1ec-e6b47780ffb5)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n- Add an update for the current setpoint altitude when the home point is changed. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Test coverage\r\n- Simulation/hardware testing logs:https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=0488b27d-6137-481a-9bb1-1b084777b2de\r\n\r\n\r\n",

not initialized because `MissionBase::initMission()` failed, because `_dataman_client.readSync()` timed out. And then `MissionBase::resetMission()` only copied the new data on `_dataman_client.writeSync()` success, which also timed out.\r\n\r\nYou can reproduce this failure by placing [a `usleep(2'000'000);` into the `dataman.cpp` `DM_WRITE` and `DM_READ` code](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/8a7573351182bcc7181bb0377e35f62b2ad267ff/src/modules/dataman/dataman.cpp#L742-L775).\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nThis change constrains the loading loop and resets the mission data even if the data write failed.\r\n\r\n### Changelog Entry\r\n\r\nFor release notes:\r\n```\r\nBugfix Prevent busy-looping on Navigator startup\r\n```",

Thus when uploading a new mission in air, the mission should get rejected, when it does not define a landing and there are no landing approaches defined for the safe points.\r\n\r\nFixes #{Github issue ID}\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nAdd a new mission check option in MIS_TKO_LAND_REQ. This option checks, if a landing is defined, when in air and no safe point approaches are defined. While on the ground, it will use the same logic as MIS_TKO_LAND_REQ=4\r\n\r\n### Changelog Entry\r\nFor release notes:\r\n```\r\nFeature: New Mission takeoff/landing required option to check for a valid landing (either mission landing or land approaches) when in air.\r\n```\r\n### Test coverage\r\n- Unit/integration test: ...\r\n- Simulation/hardware testing logs: https://review.px4.io/\r\n",

Commander publishes vehicle_status regularly, so navigator will proceed in any case.\r\n\r\n@bkueng Let's assume the following situation: the ground control station sends two successive CMDs, one instructing the drone to pause and the other to change altitude.\r\n\r\n The commander thread has received both CMDs and updated the vehicle_status twice accordingly. \r\n\r\nIn the navigator_main thread, the braking point is calculated based on the first CMD, and it is published because _vstatus.timestamp > _wait_for_vehicle_status_timestamp.\r\n\r\nHowever, when it comes to executing the second CMD (change altitude), the navigator_main is blocked since the vehicle_status no longer changes. \r\n\r\nThrough my testing, the current patch can address the existing issue. This is because the commander's update of vehicle_status is slightly slower than the execution in navigator_main (which is also the initial reason why the drone couldn't pause). However, if in the future, there are new functionalities in navigator_main that execute more slowly than vehicle_status, it will trigger the aforementioned problem.\r\n\r\n**Do you think we should further introduce mutex or semaphore mechanisms?

This is due to the fact that although the vtol takeoff item is accepted immediately, it is still set as the position setpoint previous item including the transition altitude specified. This results in the VTOL losing altitude up to the transition item when the current altitude is higher. It should completely ignore the vtol takeoff item when already airborne.\r\n\r\nFixes #{Github issue ID}\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n- For all mission modes, ignore the VTOL Takeoff item if the vehicle is already in Air and already transitioned to fixed wing.\r\n\r\n### Changelog Entry\r\nFor release notes:\r\n```\r\nBugfix Ignore VTOL takeoff when already in air and transitioned to fixed wing\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Test coverage\r\n- SITL testing using the standard vtol. \r\n\r\n",

This means that when the VTOL takeoff is performed on the ground, as soon as the vehicle transitioned, then the Takeoff is accepted and it flies to the line between the takeoff and the next waypoint instead of explicitly flying to the takeoff position until it is accepted. So you don't need to fly backwards if the vehicle flew past it while transitioning etc. But this is open for discussion.",

That was one of them: https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/22114. And it came up again in https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/23681. \r\nLetting Navigator decide on whether to publish a IDLE or POSITION setpoint based on land_detection is quite fragile and prone for race conditions, so I would rather have Navigator publish only real position setpoints and add logic in the controllers to idle the motors if needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nRemove IDLE.\r\nInstead it should be the controllers responsibility to not spin up the motors if landed and not in a mode that allows takeoff (takeoff mode/type or in a manual control mode, but certainly not in Loiter). That is already done for MC, and with 5a38ad7dfb38a5a766fd4f9581611894a50a4840 I added this also to FW. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Test coverage\r\nI tested only very basic things in SITL yet, like \r\n- arming in Loiter mode (motors should not go above idle)\r\n- MC takeoff and RTL (motors should cleanly ramp down)",

Something to keep in mind!\r\n\r\nI now made it so that Landing Flightmode goes into FlightTaskLand, and Precision landing remains in FlightTaskAuto.\r\nThis way we can/should split out precision landing into its own flight task in the future, or also integrate it into FlightTaskLand.\r\n\r\nI wasn't able to also integrate precision landing into it, as i dont have the means to test it, and FlightTaskLand is currently not set up to handle movement around to setpoint triplets as FlightTaskAuto. it just brakes, and lands.

      "body": "Currently, when flying with only optical flow in position mode, you can easily surpass the max HAGL by continuously pushing the throttle up. The vehicle decelerates until it eventually exceeds the limit. At that point, we immediately lose optical flow measurements (when above the max height), and consequently, the HAGL max parameter is no longer set.\r\nI modified the controller to limit the altitude to 1 meter (or 10%) below the actual max height limit. This ensures that even after approaching the limit, optical flow remains active, and the controller tries to correct the altitude.\r\n\r\nPreviously, the HAGL max also influenced the controller in altitude mode, which was undesirable when using a range sensor or barometer. To resolve this, I split the HAGL max field of the local position message into hagl_max_z (for vertical control) and hagl_max_xy (for horizontal position control).\r\n\r\nWhen flying at max_hgt_xy, the platform descends if the terrain elevation decreases, in order to maintain a valid local position estimate. Additionally, when flying near the hagl_max_xy limit, I adjust the maximum horizontal velocity to reduce the risk of losing optical flow due to rapid elevation changes.\r\n\r\nTo avoid adding new subscribers, the hagl_max controller setting is still handled in the estimator.\r\nIn the FlightTaskManAcc, I now set the max_dist_to_ground of the FlightTaskManAlt because it depends on whether ManAcc is running. Since ManAlt cannot directly check if ManAcc is running (as it's a cascaded controller), this adjustment was necessary in order to keep it simple.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e17b1b34-0892-4720-95ae-97113366f2fa)\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nPlease also give some feedback if this behavior fits what a typical user would expect.\r\n",

      "body": "### Solved Problem\r\nWhen flying Fixed Wings in a space constrained area, it can be difficult to plan the usual orbit type mission landings.\r\nThere might simply not be enough space for the vehicle to orbit while it's descending in altitude.\r\n\r\nOf course, one can just plan a mission with simple waypoints and add a VTOL LAND waypoint at the end. However, there is always the risk that the altitude difference between the waypoints is too big and the vehicle cannot follow the glide-slope, causing it to loiter at the next waypoint in order to reduce altitude further. This behavior is highly undesirable as part of a mission landing, as already explained above.\r\n\r\nFixes #{Github issue ID}\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nI propose a solution where all simple waypoints AFTER a land stark marker have their altitude acceptance radius set to INFINITY, which will cause the guidance logic to track altitude for these waypoints based on best effort.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changelog Entry\r\nFor release notes:\r\n```\r\nFeature\r\nDocumentation: Add documentation for QGC explaining the difference between the two types of landings.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Test coverage\r\nTested regularly in production but on a much older branch. Only SITL tested on main.\r\n\r\n### Context\r\nAltitude profile for staright line landing. Notice, that for the first waypoints the altitude needs to reached, however, for the last waypoints (landing pattern), the altitude is not reached anymore, but the waypoint is still accepted.\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0e806a3-647a-4807-92a3-802be746ce67)\r\n\r\n",

In navigator there exists the get_altitude_acceptance_radius. In the navigator you have also access to the position setpoint. So there you could actually ready out the altitude radius in the current position setpoint, and if it is not NaN, just pass it along, else use the default one as calculated in the function as well.

This means that the mission feasibility can change during flight if moving further away from the first waypoint. The mission feasibility should not be able to change depending on the current position of the AV.  Especially when a long mission is flown and interrupted, the mission check should make a mission infeasible because the AV did fly away from the fist mission item.\r\n\r\nSince the first waypoint mission check should indicate that potentially an old mission from another location is loaded in PX4 it should not be able to change the feasibility in flight \r\n\r\nFixes #{Github issue ID}\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n- The 1st waypoint check only generates a warning in QGC, but does not invalidate a mission\r\n- The 1st waypoint check is performed against the home position\r\n\r\n### Changelog Entry\r\nFor release notes:\r\n```\r\nChange: First waypoint mission check only generates a warning, but mission can still be executed\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\nThe home position can stil change during a flight and a even better point would be to specifically take a takeoff location which would be constant for an entire flight (AFAIK does not exist yet). Also it can still be argued if the check should make the whole mission infeasible, for simplicity, it was converted to a warning only.\r\n\r\n### Test coverage\r\n- Tested in SITL simulation with the standard VTOL configuration.\r\n  - Upload a valid mission and test mission functionality\r\n  - Reduce MIS_DIST_1WP to 1m and check that watning appears after mission feasibility is calculated again\r\n  - Make sure mission can still be executed even with warning\r\n  - Create a mission close to the vehicle and set MIS_DIST_1WP to barely include the first waypoint\r\n  - Fly away manually\r\n  - Execute mission again, make dure mission can still be flown but a warning is displayed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Context\r\nRelated links, screenshot before/after, video\r\n",

This directly corrects incorrect landing behavior (drifting/jerking) caused by not compensating horizontal velocity, so it fixes a logic bug in the landing/state-transition logic. Review notes suggest it may be a pragmatic workaround (avoiding _updateInternalWaypoints) rather than fixing the underlying internal-waypoint update, but the change does resolve the undesired behavior."

Currently, commander/navigator are unaware of this and are allowed to trigger RTL with an altitude higher than the maximum value, leading to a descend. When below the max HAGL, the navigation re-starts and commander tries to RTL again. The vehicle is then stuck in a loop.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nRTL shouldn't send the vehicle to an altitude above the mag HAGL. Sending the drone to the max HAGL and then to home is dangerous too, so the best option is to land instead.\r\n\r\nNew uORB topic: `navigator_status` is used to report when a navigator mode fails to execute.\r\nCommander monitors this field and triggers a failsafe if the current navigator mode fails.\r\n\r\n### Changelog Entry\r\nFor release notes:\r\n```\r\n-\r\nNew parameter: -\r\nDocumentation: -\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Test coverage\r\nsitl with optical flow\r\n",

Once in inertial dead-reckoning, the position estimate drifts exponentially and even if a velocity-aiding sensor starts after some time, the global position shouldn't be valid anymore.\r\n2. FW manual position control mode requires a valid global position estimate but internally works using local coordinates. The mode thus cannot run without a GNSS fix or a manual reset despite having a \"valid local position\" (due to airspeed and sideslip fusion).\r\n3. Flying in FW using wind dead-reckoning requires to set the COM_FS_EPH to a really large value as commander would otherwise invalidate the local position validity\r\n4. FW auto takeoff and auto land modes don't require a valid global position to start but the backend can't execute correctly because it relies on a valid global position estimate.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n1. Invalidate global position when exceeding maximum the inertial dead-reckoning time (5s). The global position can then be valid again if the local position is valid and that a global position measurement is available (e.g.: GNSS, AGP or manual pos aiding).\r\n2. Make FW manual position work with local coordinates only\r\n3. Generalize the local position \"relaxed\" logic (currently used for optical flow) to work when the local position is obtained from velocity-aided dead reckoning (e.g.: optical flow, ev_vel, airspeed+sideslip)\r\n4. Deny switching to auto takeoff and auto land if global position is invalid. In the future we could also fix the logic to enable it correctly.\r\n\r\nNote that we could publish NANs in the global position fields that are invalid but I wanted to follow the same scheme than in `vehicle_local_position`.\r\n\r\n### Test coverage\r\nSITL tests:\r\nIn FW, start and stop several times GNSS and sideslip fusion. Modes switch correctly.\r\n![Screenshot from 2024-07-31 14-56-28](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e94121ec-dae8-41b2-8c73-2f8f2b755d05)\r\n",

If during this time the distance sensor measurement is wrong (e.g. 1m), it would trigger the \"Terrain collision risk\" warning and adapt the current altitude setpoint to the current altitude. Once above the landing point it will then still set the setpoint type to Land and come down, so beside the warning the user wouldn't notice anything else.",

In cases of strong wind or depleted batteries, it might not be possible for the vehicle to climb into the acceptance radius. However, this is also unnecessary, as the goal is eventually to descend.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nSet the altitude acceptance radius to infinity when we are moving to the land point after the backtransition.\r\n\r\n### Changelog Entry\r\nFor release notes:\r\n```\r\nFeature/Bugfix XYZ\r\nNew parameter: XYZ_Z\r\nDocumentation: Need to clarify page ... / done, read docs.px4.io/...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\nWe could also ...\r\n\r\n### Test coverage\r\n- Unit/integration test: ...\r\n- Simulation/hardware testing logs: https://review.px4.io/\r\n\r\n### Context\r\nRelated links, screenshot before/after, video\r\n",

It adds an explicit wait/timeout after CMD_DO_GIMBAL_MANAGER_PITCHYAW (reusing the pattern for winch/gripper) to ensure the gimbal reaches the commanded orientation before the mission proceeds, which corrects the unintended behavior."

It doesn't have any negative effect currently from why I see but still seems wrong.\r\n- No precision landing possible in RTL_TYPE=2 and no mission landing planned (RtlMissionFastReverse)\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n- Check for the setting of `RTL_PLD_MD` and only `startPrecLand()` if precision landing is enabled, plus harden `startPrecLand()` to not do anything if not precision landing is not enabled.\r\n- check `RTL_PLD_MD` in RtlMissionFastReverse and execute precision landing if set accordingly (similar logic as in RtlDirect)\r\n\r\n### Changelog Entry\r\nFor release notes: \r\n```\r\nBugfix: Navigator: RTL_direct: onyl start precision land if param is set to enabled\r\nBugfix: Navigator: RTL: use precision landing if enabled in param RTL_PLD_MD also for reverse mission RTL\r\n```\r\n\r\n",

So the same outcome as with `RTL_TYPE`=0 (direct RTL to Home) and `RTL_PLD_MD` set to 1 or 2.\r\n\r\nI think where it's not working atm though is RTL_TYPE=2 but then don't plan a mission landing.

Further I disable the [breaking distance calculation](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/23546) in this case, as it's requiring global position.

You switch to a manual mode no?\r\nI would focus on making the detection of \"bad local position estimation\" more reliable. If local position is declared invalid while in \"Land\", the system already automatically switches to Descend.

Thus [this condition](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/dbba9adb14b5210498287168396333d57ffb2fb9/src/modules/navigator/rtl_direct.cpp#L429) is always invalid, leading to always pick the `getActivationLandState()` instead of current altitude.\r\n- `isActive()` is also used in another part of rtl_direct. I don't think it caused issues but I remove the check here, as I don't see how it would be necessary\r\n- the loiter_altitude used for [the calculation the remaining time when already being in the last phase](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/dbba9adb14b5210498287168396333d57ffb2fb9/src/modules/navigator/rtl_direct.cpp#L530C25-L530C41) is set to `RTL_DESCEND_ALT`, and it is wrongly assumed that 1) vehicle starts this last LAND phase really only at this altitude and 2) that in this phase it sinks with `MPC_LAND_SPEED` all the way. Instead the sink speed is only reduced when in the last few meters of the landing, as is linked to distance sensor data usually. For the sake of simplicity I removed the distinction between land and sink speed, as I don't think it really matters. The RTL time estimate will anyway always be a few seconds off, and if we want to change that we need to feed in distance sensor data etc. Not worth IMO. IF we remove the distinction then the still wrong assumption of \"LAND phase starting below RTL_DESCEND_ALTITUDE\" . \r\n\r\nMaybe https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/23689 introduced some of the issues, or at least surfaced the bugs.\r\n\r\n### Changelog Entry\r\nFor release notes: \r\n```\r\nBugfix: RTL: fix RTL time estimation of MC landing phase\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Test coverage\r\nRTL direct tested in SITL (multicopter).\r\n",

With bad heading and position estimation, the auto takeoff mode doesn't work reliably, which can lead to crashes or failsafe actions being executed. The current navigation loss failsafe for fixed-wings is Descend, which is dangerous to trigger while still being close to the ground. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nAdd a new flight mode `Takeoff without navigation`. It is currently only implemented for fixed-wing vehicles (even only for non-runway takeoff ones), and keeps most of the normal fixed-wing takeoff behavior with one big difference: instead of doing lateral guidance to fly to a takeoff waypoint or to keep course of ground constant, this new mode simply commands a 0° roll setpoint until the takeoff altitude is reached.\r\nAfter reaching the takeoff altitude the flight mode automatically switches to Hold (Loiter).\r\n\r\nThis mode is also used to fall-back to from the normal Takeoff mode should during the takeoff procedure the navigation become invalid. It then proceeds with climbing, and gives the pilot more time to take over.\r\n\r\n### Changelog Entry\r\nFor release notes:\r\n```\r\nFeature: Add fixed-wing takeoff mode without lateral navigation requirement\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\n\r\n\r\n### Test coverage\r\nIn progress\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The following optimizations are possible:\r\n1. Simple optimizations, by moving `do_jump_mission_index`, `do_jump_repeat_count`, `do_jump_current_count`, `vertex_count` and `land_precision` into the main union. This is possible as they are set to `param1/param2` so a storage outside of the union is not needed\r\n2. Not storing the \"working copy\" `lat` and `lon` in `mission_item_s` anymore. This is a space-time tradeoff as it causes an additional condition + double multiplication at every access\r\n\r\nWith both optimizations it is possible to save **24 byte** per MissionItem.\r\n\r\n### Open points\r\n- [ ] Do functional testing\r\n- [ ] Measure performance impact\r\n- [ ] Backwards compatibility\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\nOne possible alternative is two have different MissionItems for storage and working. Then the one for working could still contain doubles, while the storage one would only contain the `int32` representation. This however would need bigger changes as the MissionItems are currently used throughout the code in many different scenarios.\r\n",

The painful but correct way to do this would be to explicitly allow both Navigator and FlightTaskAuto to use local position if there is a flow/VIO system providing a solid estimate. To expand on this I think all of those sub-modes inside of Navigator should be moved to FlightTasks and all of the airframe specific logic in Navigator should be refactored into their own files/functions.

      "body": "\r\n### Solved Problem\r\nThe current limit of mission items is quite low. For large survey missions it's possible to exceed the limit of 500. This limit was introduce when the ability to store [missions on RAM was added](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/18827), as RAM is much more limited than the SDcard in terms of available storage space, and a full RAM leads to a hard-fault. \r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nAdd `#define RAM_CONSTRAINED_SYSTEM` to specify if a board has a constrained RAM space, in which case the limit is left at 500. If that define is not set then open up the limit to 1000 (arbitrary number). \r\n\r\nSide question: is MEMORY_CONSTRAINED_SYSTEM even set anywhere?\r\n\r\n### Changelog Entry\r\nFor release notes:\r\n```\r\nImprovement: Navigator/boards: introduce `#define RAM_CONSTRAINED_SYSTEM` for reduced mission length\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\n@MaEtUgR mentioned that we could consider reducing the amount of data such a mission write needs, at least if stored on RAM. Binding the max mission size to `SYS_DM_BACKEND` is likely not feasible. \r\n\r\nThis is just an initial draft PR to kick off some discussion, I didn't go through all the boards and labeled them correctly with `RAM_CONSTRAINED_SYSTEM`.\r\n",

There seem to be multiple different english versions in other language subdirectories, I still don't understand why such outdated non-translated versions exist.\r\n\r\n### Changelog Entry\r\n```\r\nCleanup: Navigator: Vehicle command refactor, FlightTaskAuto: parameter clarification\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Test coverage\r\nIt's refactoring except for the reference instead of pointer but if the previous version was ever called with a `nullptr` it would have hardfaulted.\r\n",

All the states prior to `LAND` in the direct RTL state machine are unnecessary if the vehicle is of type `ROVER`.\r\n2. The parameter used for RTL time calculation for rovers is outdated\r\n3. In mission fast reverse there is a hanging `NEXT` waypoint.\r\n4. Rover land detection only detects landing during RTL if the return point is home, which does not work if the vehicle is supposed to return to a rally point etc.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n1. Direclty skip to `LAND` state on activation if the vehicle type is `ROVER`.\r\n2. Replace with correct parameter `RO_SPEED_LIM`.\r\n3. Reset the `NEXT` waypoint when landing starts.\r\n4. During RTL check if the `NEXT` waypoint is invalid which indicates that the `CURRENT` waypoint is the final waypoint.\r\n    Set the vehicle to `LANDED` if the distance to the current waypoint is less than `NAV_ACC_RAD` \r\n",

Especially for large vehicles with big loiter radii it's desired to move this place further from away (and have it at pre-defined position).\r\n- the Takeoff flight mode can be executed without global position, but was internally using global position\r\n- in https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/24280 we removed the dependency for FW vehicles on vehicle_global_position in Mission, Loiter and RTL, but seemed to have forgotten the takeoff modes\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n- use the lat/long fields [MAV_CMD_NAV_TAKEOFF](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html#MAV_CMD_NAV_TAKEOFF) to define where to loiter\r\n- only use local position in Takeoff flight mode. That should make it more robust against \r\n- only require vehicle_local_position_relaxed for Takeoff and VTOL_Takeoff\r\n\r\nIn more detail:\r\n- split up the takeoff phase into \"climbout\" and \"go to loiter\" states.\r\n- during climbout the course setpoint is fixed to the heading the vehicle had on launch and the height rate setpoint set to `FW_CLMB_MAX`\r\n- climbout altitude can be configured with new parameter (`TKO_CLMB_OUT_ALT`). We can hopefully expose this setting also to the users through a field in [NAV_TAKEOFF](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html#MAV_CMD_NAV_TAKEOFF).\r\nafter reaching the climbout altitude, the vehicle starts going to the loiter point\r\n\r\n### Changelog Entry\r\nFor release notes:\r\n```\r\nFeature: FW Takeoff: and add option to define loiter position\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\n- Add a \"climbout altitude\" field to  [MAV_CMD_NAV_TAKEOFF](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html#MAV_CMD_NAV_TAKEOFF) to replace the added param `TKO_CLMB_OUT_ALT`. \r\n- can we remove the absolute altitude dependency of TECS as a next step?\r\n\r\n### Test coverage\r\nSITL tested, partially flight tested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "logicErrorDescription": "Yes — the PR corrects incorrect takeoff behavior: the mode previously relied on global position and always loitered at the current position, which caused wrong behavior when global position was unavailable or a specific loiter point was desired. The changes remove the global-position dependency (use local position for execution), use MAV_CMD_NAV_TAKEOFF lat/long for the loiter point, and split climbout/go-to-loiter states to enforce correct state transitions and setpoints."

      "body": "Replaces https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/23797\r\n\r\n### Solved Problem\r\n- A navigation failsafe during the climbout of a takeoff can be fatal, as the system doesn't have much clearance to the ground yet. It thus better to keep climbing in that case instead of failsafing.\r\n- It's currently not possible to define the position of the loiter that gets established upon climbing to the takeoff altitude, instead it will just loiter at the current position. Especially for large vehicles with big loiter radii it's desired to move this place further from away (and have it at pre-defined position).\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n- check `local_position.xy_valid` in the FW mode manager, and in case of invalidity, set lateral_acceleration to 0 (instead of holding a course setpoint)\r\n- use the lat/long fields [MAV_CMD_NAV_TAKEOFF](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html#MAV_CMD_NAV_TAKEOFF) to define where to loiter\r\n\r\nIn more detail:\r\n- split up the takeoff phase into \"climbout\" and \"go to loiter\" states.\r\n- during climbout the course setpoint is fixed to the heading the vehicle had on launch and the height rate setpoint set to `FW_CLMB_MAX`\r\n- climbout is done once the altitude of the takeoff (loiter) is reached\r\n- if a navigation failsafe happens while the vehicle is in takeoff (e.g. GNSS and airspeed failure), it will keep climbing with wings level\r\n- the takeoff flight mode for FW doesn't require any local or global position validity, thus can be activated inside a tube without GNSS and with mag disturbance\r\n\r\n### Changelog Entry\r\nFor release notes:\r\n```\r\nFeature: FW Takeoff: keep climbing with wings level in case of navigation loss\r\nFeature: FW Takeoff: and add option to define loiter position\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Test coverage\r\nSITL tested, flight tested.\r\n\r\n- \"all normal flight\"\r\n--> vehicle climbed to takeoff altitude while holding course to center of loiter, once passed the altitude it established loiter at defined location and switched to Hold mode.\r\n\r\n- \"navigation loss flight\" (GNSS denied and without airspeed sensor fusion)\r\n<img width=\"1431\" height=\"987\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37105015-9669-411c-828b-189f6d287a24\" />\r\n--> vehicle climbs with wings level until takeoff altitude is reached, then failsafes to fixed-bank loiter\r\n\r\n\r\n",

If we only documented what QGC can do we'd have about 1/2 the functionality :-)\r\n\r\nIf we just document the minimum then no one can, for example, know that they might control this using MAVLink, ROS2, or that they the could add the implementation to QGC.\r\n\r\nI have done a first draft in https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/25226 to simplify the task. \r\n",

It also splits takeoff into climbout and go‑to‑loiter states and lets the loiter position be specified, addressing improper state transitions and undesired loiter-location behavior that could be unsafe near the ground."

If there are items after the land index, then they don't belong to the landing anymore.\r\n\r\n### Changelog Entry\r\nFor release notes:\r\n```\r\nFeature/Bugfix isLanding() in MissionBase only return true during landing\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Test coverage\r\nTested in SITL: Mission with multiple landings.

      "body": "This implements very basic RTL behavior using a cone to define the required return altitude (see figure below). Currently the user can define the half-angle of the cone and the cone is centered around the home position. If the vehicle is inside the cone, it will return at the current altitude.\r\nIf the vehicle is outside the cone the vehicle will first climb until it either intersects the cone or reaches the parametrized return altitude, whichever is lower.\r\nThe vehicle will always at least climb to the parametrized descend altitude.\r\n\r\nCone half angle parameter special cases:\r\n<=0: this will lead to the RTL behavior we currently have. The drone will always climb to the return altitude.\r\n .>= 90: In this case the drone will always return at the current altitude with the only restriction that this altitude must be larger than the RTL descend altitude.\r\n\r\nI did some basic testing in SITL but it needs more. Also feel free to comment on the choice of cone parameter and it's default value.\r\n![rtl](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7610489/60448520-11a18880-9c26-11e9-818c-dbf6538faa3c.jpg)\r\n",

Groups are defined by START/STOP items and 64bit unsigned integer ID. A group can be nested inside another group. When control reaches MAV_CMD_GROUP_START or MAV_CMD_GROUP_END it emits GROUP_START message with group ID and current timestamp.\r\nIf current mission item is set with a command (jumping to any of the items in the plan) then we scan all mission items from the start and find all groups that should be opened or closed.\r\n\r\n**Describe possible alternatives**\r\n\r\n**Test data / coverage**\r\nManually tested with QGC on the GCS, PX4 + mavlink_router + camera_manager on the vehicle.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n",

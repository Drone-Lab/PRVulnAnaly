In practice they can be problematic.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84712/41783807-cf8db7c0-760b-11e8-9718-e162f3b479e1.png)\n\nDo we even need these warnings PX4 side? I think of the mission feasibility checker as the last line of defence for loading something bogus. If we also want it to return helpful warnings it needs a better interface.",

Mostly because people are stupid and produce fly-aways by “fat finger planning”.\r\n\r\nTime again for the events interface discussion.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime I would just increase the distance considerably. Most of the times people hit a completely wrong location many miles away, not something close. That is what we want to prevent.",

        "body": "Actually I'm only talking specifically about the warnings that are 2/3rds of the error. I don't have a problem with the feasibility checker rejecting a mission that actually exceeds the parameter value. What I don't see is the value in a mavlink critical warning when the mission is still going to be accepted.",

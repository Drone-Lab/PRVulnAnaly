    "body": " Based on #10037 \n\n- if the vehicle projected position on the line previous-current triplet is past the current triplet, acceptance radius is enlarged such that navigator updates the triplets\n- if the vehicle is within the xy acceptance radius but not inside the z one, enlarge the altitude acceptance radius such that navigator updates the triplets set the feedback yaw acceptance to NAN such that it is ignored by navigator\n\nMissions shouldn't get stuck anymore because a waypoint is not reachable or a waypoint is reached with a heading different from what navigator expects",

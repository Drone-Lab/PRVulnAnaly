    "body": "**Describe problem solved by this pull request**\r\nThe transition command waypoints, NAV_CMD_DO_VTOL_TRANSITION, are attached to the previous waypoint that contains a location (e.g. normal waypoint). It then triggers a transition as soon as this waypoint is reached, which happens when the vehicle is within L1 distance to it. Is the L1 distance smaller then the needed space for the transition, then the vehicle overshoots. The current logic is that for a transition waypoint, the waypoint has to be reached again in the new VTOL mode (e.g. in hover after a backtransition). Thus, if it overshoots, it turns around to accept it, and only then proceeds to the next waypoint.\r\nI don't really get in which case this would be desired.\r\n\r\nThis can lead to ugly situations like this:\r\n![VTOLtransitionmaster](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26798987/103775614-98f76580-502e-11eb-95ef-b0b14f675bba.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe your solution**\r\nDo not make it accept the waypoint again in the new VTOL mode, but directly proceed to the next:\r\n![vtoltransition_withfixes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26798987/103775628-9e54b000-502e-11eb-860b-d1f55a596d98.png)\r\nThat means that if you don't have the previous, current and next waypoint in one line, it will make a turn while transitioning. I don't think this should be a big issue, and what we on top could do is limiting the max roll angle during the transition.\r\n\r\n**Describe possible alternatives**\r\n\r\n\r\n**Test data / coverage**\r\nBasic SITL testing.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nhttps://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/commit/c31d8ce2b6f04c30b2fde6af08040c074e70e762 looks like it only works with this stuff removed. @dagar Am I missing something or could we safely remove it?

It may well be obsolete by now though as the way transitions are handled have changed significantly. The code was added almost 5 years ago (https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/3598), which is about three years before I started working with PX4. :sweat_smile: ",

And after some more SITLing I came to the same conclusion as you, that without the check for the transition_state it's much smoother.

I vaguely recalled something like that, but wasn't aware of the details. ~~Still undeniably there is a difference in how the front transition is handled in the two logs of https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/16499#discussion_r553249245... but I have to admit I no longer understand why~~ Ok, it's me who was stupid, the drone was aligned differently before the transition started.\r\n\r\nDo you still think it is better to set this artificial heading hold waypoint for the whole duration of the front transition or could we just have it track the normal waypoints ? And in case it reaches the first FW WP while still in transition move towards the next one.\r\n\r\nI think both ways have advantages and drawbacks. In my dream world the drone can handle any type of turns during transition if needed. But I also see that if you ask for a harsh turn during transition it might not end well - even though so far what I saw looked quite stable in the air with the L1 tracking during transition.\r\n\r\nMy main concern with the \"stubborn\" heading hold is that if you have a tight geofence just flying straight no matter what might get you closer to the geofence than you'd like, e.g. with tail wind. Or also without geofence, if the drone has to do a full bank turn to backtrack just after transition it's not great either. Admittedly, in these cases you can also say badly planned mission.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand we'd have a more reliable planned trajectory if the front transition really tracks the planned WPs (as it now does with the back transition). My main worries are potential hard turns during transition, where again you can say badly planned mission. \r\n\r\nAll in all, I'd have a slight preference to tracking the planned WPs, but it's not something I'd consider blocking for this PR.

In real flight you can have wind gusts, thrust assymentry on the frame, bad compass calibration or just constant wind that make the transition to end in a slightly different point that planned. Try to end in such waypoint may require large control imputs in conditions near stall, that in most airframes can generate aerodynamic control inversion (lowering the aileron to generate lift stalls the wing and generates the opposite effect).

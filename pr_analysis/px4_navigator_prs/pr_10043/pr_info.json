This will cause the vehicle to fail to takeoff. I added the log statement (RESETTING TAKEOFF TO POSITION) at line 524 in `mission_block.cpp` which confirms that land detector thinks we are no longer `landed`.\n\n**Describe your preferred solution**\nCheck that  the vehicle is not  _`maybe_landed`_ as well as not _`landed`_ upon takeoff.",

Landing approaches using mission landing can be optimized for current wind direction (transition into the wind), and result in less hover time (vehicle transitions over hover, instead of while loitering around home)\r\n",

I wonder how many VTOL people would always want to use the mission landing if at all possible?  The \"return to home\" fall-back in the RTL_TYPE=1 logic was originally designed for the case when the mission landing accidentally gets deleted or gets overwritten with an infeasible landing pattern (which unfortunately is something that can easily happen).  \r\n\r\nFrom the way this PR is currently written you intend the VTOL vehicle will perform different Return mode behaviors depending on the context.  I wonder if that is how 100% of VTOL users will want it to work.  I'm not a VTOL expert so I'm not advocating one way or another, just curious.",

I actually wrote it down wrongly in the description. It will **always use the mission landing for RTL if RTL_TYPE is 1**. What changes is that it now won't follow the landing pattern (all that is after the DO_LAND_START) in hover, but directly go to Land and descend there. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

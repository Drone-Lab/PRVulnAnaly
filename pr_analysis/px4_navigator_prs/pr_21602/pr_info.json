    "body": "### Solved Problem\r\nWhen switching between different vehicle types on the same groundstation, it can happen that by accident a mission that was planned for example for a VTOL gets uploaded to a Multicopter. This is can lead to undesired/unexpected behavior.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nAdd `checkItemsFitToVehicleType()` check that checks if the vehicle type is non-VTOL but there are VTOL mission items (VTOL_TAKEOFF, VTOL_LAND, VTOL_TRANSITION). The check can later be extended to handle all kind of vehicle type vs mission item checks.\r\n\r\n### Changelog Entry\r\nFor release notes:\r\n```\r\nFeature: Mission Feasibility Check: prevent uploading a mission containing VTOL items to non-VTOL vehicles\r\n```\r\n\r\n",

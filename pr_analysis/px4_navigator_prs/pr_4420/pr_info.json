    "body": "If the auto mission is paused/aborted during take-off and we land in manual mode, then work_item_type needs to be reset unless we re-power. Otherwise, it is set to WORK_ITEM_TYPE_TAKEOFF, and take-off waypoint is treated as normal position waypoint next time mission is launched. Thus, controller does not use take-off logic but position control logic. \n",

For the approach it will use the altitude specified in the landing waypoint.\nI'm not very sure if this is the correct altitude. What is the meaning of the landing waypoint altitude?\n",

It could as well be that 0 is a valid relative landing WP altitude if the target landing point is below home. Because the user always specifies the altitude for a normal WP I would just keep that behaviour consistent as Roman described.\n",

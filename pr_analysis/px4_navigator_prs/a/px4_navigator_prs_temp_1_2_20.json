Airspeed mode is the minimum manual mode that's appropriate (safe) for an operator without RC experience.\nIt's a stabilized mode with manual throttle and airspeed controlled with the pitchstick. It feels similar to STAB, but you can't stall the plane.\n\n**Questions**\n- ~~where should this fit in with the existing modes and switches?~~\n- ~~this mode is much better with the TECS time constant significantly reduced, could it scale automatically?~~ You just need to properly tune TECS\n- ~~this doesn't currently work with mTecs, does anyone use it?~~\n- ~~should this mode respect FW_THR_MIN/FW_THR_MAX?~~\n",

If you don’t then the turn will be limited to the safe limit, but it will always allow a bank of at least 25 degrees (to ensure you can still maneuver if your airspeed estimate is badly off).\n\nWe've seen this technique in other two more simpler controllers and it works.\n\n> when in auto-throttle modes the autopilot will also raise the minimum airspeed in the TECS system to the level at which the current demanded bank angle can be safely achieved. So it will add more engine power or lower the nose to raise the airspeed so that the bank angle that the navigation controller is demanding can be achieved without a stall\n\nThey use these two parameters:\n\n> The **STALL_PREVENTION** parameter. If this is set to zero then no stall prevention is done. This may be useful if you have no airspeed sensor and the synthetic airspeed estimate is not good \n> enough\n> \n> The **ARSPD_FBW_MIN** parameter, which is the configured minimum airspeed for level flight. It is this value that is scaled with the bank angle to calculate the safe airspeed for any demanded bank angle\n\nI'm not saying we have to copy, but there is not a big choice of approaches toward stall. It is classical physics.  \n",

      "body": "adds ability for px4 firmware to track a target.  Implements rudimentary following of target position in navigator.\n\nNote: this uses a new version of the mavlink library with the proposed follow target method, will not work with current mavlink library version.\n\nhttps://github.com/catch-twenty-two/mavlink\n\nAlso uses new version of qground control with follow me option implemented:\n\nhttps://github.com/mavlink/qgroundcontrol/pull/2817\n\nSome concerns:\n\nPlease comment on ideas for error checking on bad position sent from tracker.  (e.g. ignore tracker if new pos vector is x meters away and instead just loiter)\n\nDoes it make sense for the \"follow previous - current line\" following be activated for this?  (currently I have it activated) I guess this might come in handy for intermittent GPS being sent...\n\nIn both instances ( \"follow previous - current line\" on and off) the result is \"jumpy\" if the new sp is to close to the current set point. \n\nMaybe this entire follow feature needs to be treated more like an instance using the position control code, except instead of manual input it gets tracker input. Or maybe it needs to be some type of hybrid of both pos control and auto line/position following code.\n\nAnyways, just some ideas, I'd like to get other's suggestions. \n\n@LorenzMeier had suggested using a predictive model if we have the target velocity. (this doesn't seem to be an option on my nexus 7 as it doesn't seem to output gps velocity)\n\nHere is a video of the current implementation, Qground control has been coded to send out sinusoidal gps coors, you can see the jumpiness I am referring to:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGC464eVI5E&feature=youtu.be\n",

          "body": "This reminded me of the target following I had implemented in APM a few years ago (used the same fixed wing libraries (l1 with TECS) as we do now) and the issues I faced. I did it by setting the target's position as the waypoints for the 'follower' (also I think I overwrote the current target waypoint with the latest waypoint I received from the target. Otherwise, the follower's position oscillated heavily). \nThis strategy 'works' but you end up with steady state error between the target(say, moving in a straight line) and the follower (who never got directly in line behind the target, was always a bit to the left or the right). This can be seen in the following pic:\n\n![dsc_0615](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3105122/13201714/9179428e-d87d-11e5-9f86-2a6d8ccab171.JPG)\n\nYou can see the green plane (fixed wing UAV) is following not directly behind the leader, but to the side. This was because unlike a single static waypoint, the waypoints in this case were constantly overwritten to the new target position values, with the controller never getting the time to correct the steady state error. This made me feel that, atleast for fixedwings, tracking moving targets required something more than just setting moving waypoints from the controls point of view.\n\nYou can see a mission with 3 aircrafts daisy-chained here:\n![3-ac-lf-2013-09-28 13_41_29](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3105122/13201743/7d2f5934-d87e-11e5-85f1-1635b420890e.png)\n",

Its about orienting the plane into the wind so that wind gusts do not completely ruin the position and attitude control response.

It would mean that you would see the system constantly yaw in wind, coupled with roll and pitch. Two motors would run at their maximum capacity and overheat.

This means that now everyone using `sensor_combined` gets voted data, including ekf2. It also adds voting for the baro.\n- use relative timestamps, necessary for the new logger. Logging `sensor_combined` at full rate now only needs 18KB/s.\n- Memory savings: when using the `q` estimator, we get almost 2kB of additional RAM, with ekf2 it's roughly 0.6kB. This is because ekf2 did not do voting, and voting itself is quite heavy, it requires 1.5kB.\n\nThis introduces a lot of changes at central places, affecting all estimators. Nothing complex, but still, it needs careful review and testing all of the estimators.\n\nI still plan to break up the sensors class into several smaller classes to make things easier to maintain.\n",

A new (or existing param) should be used to add a time constant (front transition time).\nAt the moment we have a VT_F_TRANS_DUR (front transition duration) param which in effect is the ramp-up time for the pusher motor. To avoid confusion i propose to rename this to VT_F_TRANS_RAMP and use VT_F_TRANS_TIME as the new constant.\n\nAlternatively we could rely on VT_TRANS_MIN_TM but this will have defaulted to low values by now.\n@tumbili ?\n",

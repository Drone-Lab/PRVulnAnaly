This results in the same behavior when switching into Hold/Loiter mode directly (either through RC switch or in the flight mode selection in QGC) or through the \"Hold\" button in QGC (which sends a DO_REPOSITION with the fields at the current position). \r\n\r\nIn this screen recording you see the behavior prior and after this PR.\r\nhttps://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/assets/26798987/9079b575-77fc-40a2-be54-b3c11816cca3\r\n\r\n### Changelog Entry\r\nFor release notes:\r\n```\r\nBugfix: Fixed-wing: Always establish loiter around current position when switching into Hold mode\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\nFix detection on whether we're currently on an established loiter, and in that case don't loiter around current position but keep established loiter. Personally I though prefer to stick to Hold = Loiter around current position always. Imagine being on a huge loiter. If the vehicle then keeps following it it's hardly anymore \"Holding position\". \r\n\r\n",

I've tried to clean up the logic a bit and make it less entangled.\r\n\r\n### Solved Problem\r\nSurvey mission contain, beside the position items, contain items for gimbal config, camera mode config, and camera trigger. When the execution of a mission is stopped, we want also to stop the camera from taking pictures and move the gimbal back to neutral. Upon resuming the mission though, we have to re-configure gimbal and camera and start the triggering once back on the mission path.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nStore (cache) all gimbal/camera/trigger mission items and replay them on resuming the mission. In detail:\r\n- `on_inactivation() `store the currently active index as `_inactivation_index`\r\n- `on_activation()`, store all gimbal/camera/trigger items up to the currently active index and reset the mission to the previous. Also set flag (`_align_heading_necessary`) that a yaw alignment is required upon reaching this waypoint (we want to only start triggering once yaw is correctly aligned with next WP).\r\n- `on_active()`\r\n  - if `_align_heading_necessary` is set and mission item is reached, update current item with yaw field and force it to accept that one before starting the trigger.\r\n  - read the gimbal and camera mode command items from cache, thus making the gimbal move to the right orientation and setting the right camera mode\r\n  - read the trigger commands once the previous waypoint incl. yaw alignment is accepted\r\n\r\nFurther:\r\n- reset cached items if mission is updated\r\n- reset mission on disarmed only if we reached the last mission item, otherwise keep\r\n\r\n### Changelog Entry\r\nFor release notes:\r\n```\r\nFeature: Improve mission resume (e.g. replay gimbal and camera commands of a survey)\r\nDocumentation: Need to clarify page\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\nIt would be nice to not resume the mission from the previous mission item but from the actual lat/lon position where the mission was interrupted. \r\n\r\n### Test coverage\r\nSITL tested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The check can later be extended to handle all kind of vehicle type vs mission item checks.\r\n\r\n### Changelog Entry\r\nFor release notes:\r\n```\r\nFeature: Mission Feasibility Check: prevent uploading a mission containing VTOL items to non-VTOL vehicles\r\n```\r\n\r\n",

Previously, direct access to the Dataman module was used, where requests were inserted into the queue with a semaphore. This approach has now been replaced with the uORB messaging system.\r\n\r\nDatamanClient introduces both **synchronous** and **asynchronous** modes of communication with Dataman.\r\n\r\n**DatamanCache**\r\nThis class serves as a cache storage for a defined amount of Dataman items. Currently, the cache does not employ any advanced caching algorithms.\r\n\r\n**Integration within mission**\r\nThe mission now incorporates a simple caching mechanism that attempts to cache the next N items whenever the \"current item\" is modified. \r\nIn order to eliminate the need for a locking mechanism within the mission, logic has been implemented to check if the set of mission items has been updated in the Dataman. The write operation to DM_KEY_MISSION_STATE has been removed from the mavlink thread, and instead, the existing uORB (mission.msg) message is utilized.\r\n\r\n **Integration geofence and safe points**\r\nAs the information on new geofence and safe points is updated at the end, it is safe to utilize it without the need for a lock. Integration has been implemented to store all geofence and safe point items within the cache and update them whenever changes occur.\r\n\r\n**Overview of the new architecture**\r\n![image](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/assets/10188706/8fdcda1c-c64f-4e28-b03b-c52f6330c162)\r\n\r\n**Stack is increased as it was needed**\r\n![image](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/assets/10188706/65dd9daf-7440-4f1d-ac18-cdf2e7e1bc5e)\r\n",

It's not given that a mission should always start from 0. Though then the option in QGC should be there to reset the mission on landing/on vehicle boot.\r\n\r\n### Test coverage\r\nSITL tested. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

Geofence reposition lifetime: when in RTL, the geofence reposition setpoint is ignored (ok, fine) - however, the reposition struct that holds that geofence position is stored until the next flight. If a manual control loss then engages a hold (during RTL delay time), the reposition setpoint is taken for the hold, which may be anywhere else other than the vehicle's current position.. which would be the desired hold position.\r\n2. External reposition commands without a requested mode switch (flag) are silently accepted and can cause unexpected positioning when hold is engaged.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n1. In the loiter activation methods, check the reposition setpoint's timestamp in addition to validity.\r\n3. Don't allow reposition commands without a requested mode switch.\r\n\r\n### Changelog Entry\r\nFor release notes:\r\n```\r\nBugfix: Don't allow external reposition commands without a mode switch, and ensure old reposition commands are not erroneously set.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\nReal solution is not sharing the reposition struct between multiple modes, and not reusing loiter mode for goto and hold.\r\n\r\n### Test coverage\r\n- used libmav to send a reposition command without the modeswitch bit.. it rejects now\r\n- test case:\r\n  - unplug manual control\r\n  - let the multicopter rtl with geo fence boundary set near home\r\n  - geo fence sets reposition struct somewhere along the path towards home (but rtl ignores)\r\n  - vehicle lands, disarms\r\n  - arm and takeoff again in manual\r\n  - unplug manual control\r\n  - rtl ensues\r\n  - the rtl hold delay before returning to home is correctly set to the vehicle's current position (not the previously set reposition struct from last flight)",

Furthermore, navigator internally set the altitude acceptance radius for a VTOL_LAND item to infinity (don't care about altitude) while the position controller was still using the default fixed wing altitude acceptance radius. In the worst case this causes the position controller to initiate a loiter during the approach to the land waypoint when the altitude error exceeded the threshold defined by the acceptance value.\r\n\r\n\r\nFixes #{Github issue ID}\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nIt makes more sense to make the position controller aware of the setpoint type. This allows the position controller to take actions depending on the setpoint type (e.g. never loiter to recover altitude during the approach to a land waypoint.)\r\n\r\n### Changelog Entry\r\n```\r\nBugfix: Fixed issues where fixed wing position controller could instantiate a loiter when approaching a VTOL_LAND waypoint.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\n\r\n\r\n### Test coverage\r\n- Unit/integration test: ...\r\n- Simulation/hardware testing logs: https://review.px4.io/\r\n\r\n### Context\r\nRelated links, screenshot before/after, video\r\n",

In that case it's quite likely that the user does not intend to fly lower than home. But we can remove the warning when altitude mode is set to global.

Mission module per default assumed the mission was not valid when the mission uorb topic changed. Only when the mission counter is updated, it actually checks the validity of the mission. But since the mission topic gets updated as well when the geofence or safepoints changed, this would lead to wrongly failed missions in the mission module where the mission would be reset.\r\n2. The mission counter in mavlink_mission module was always set to 0 on startup. When on the last powercycle, exactly one mission was loaded, the mission counter in the dataman was set to one. On the next powerccle and the first mission upload, the mavlink_mission would report again a mission counter of 1. This would lead in the mission module to believe, that the mission was not updated at all.\r\n\r\nFixes #{Github issue ID}\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\n1. Mission module loads the previously calculated mission validity and if the mission changes, calculates it newly.\r\n2. mavlink_mission loads the mission counter on startup from the datamn (safepoints as well, already done for geofence).\r\n\r\n### Changelog Entry\r\nFor release notes:\r\n```\r\nBugfix: Mission failed on geofence/safepoint upload\r\nBufgix: Mission failed on first mission upload\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Test coverage\r\n- SITL test: checking the px4 console output.\r\n",

It is based on the earlier implementation for the mission checksum support in https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/18418, but the mission checksum in Mavlink will be deprecated in https://github.com/mavlink/mavlink/pull/2010.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n- Add an opaque Id for the mission, geofence and rally points. The opaque id is based on a Crc32 checksum as in the implementation in https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/18418\r\n- Opaque id is send from the System in the MISSION_COUNT on download. On upload, the opaque id is sent on the final MISSION_ACK\r\n- The opaque Id is also streamed continuously in the MISSION_CURRENT message, such that a GCS can detect plan changes.\r\n- The opaque id internally also replaces the mission counter, as those serves the same purpose.\r\n\r\n### Changelog Entry\r\nFor release notes:\r\n```\r\nFeature: Add Support for Mavlink mission opaque Id.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\nOpqaue id could also just be a counter instead of the Crc32. The hash implementation has the advantage that on loading the same mission (e.g. also from a file) should result in the same Id and thus the potentially multiple connected GCS does not need to download it again. Also it would allow for the feature, that a GCS does not need to download the mission on first connection if the old stored mission and opaque id is the same.\r\n\r\n### Test coverage\r\n- Unit/integration test: SITL testing by observing the mavlink message sent from the system.\r\n\r\n### Context\r\n- Before this can be merged, the respective mavlink PR should be merged\r\n",

For the mission in RAM the memory for the maximum mission/geofence/rally points is already reserved, so there wont be any additional memory cost there (and that is the reason for the difference between this PR and main, since we need to reserve double the storage in memory for geofence and rally points). When the mission is written on the SDcard, the dataman module does not need more memory depending on the mission. The only thing that is taking currently more memory when you upload bigger geofences and rally points is that the geofence and RTL mode cache all the points in memory (mission only caches the next 10 points irrespecitve of length). But that is the same both for the PR and main. So the memory difference is still the same.",

This should be used if waypoints have an associated yaw setpoint (eg landings, VTOL transitions or waypoint mission items with the yaw field set). Otherwise leave authority over yaw to the FlightTask - it can then set it e.g. to direction of the next waypoint, to current yaw, or point the vehicle into the wind with the use of weather vane. \r\n\r\nThat allows us to remove the `disable_weather_vane` field from the position_setpoint.\r\n\r\nAdditionally I propose to thin out the position_setpoint topic and remove unnecessary fields: \r\n- `yaw_valid` (yaw is declared valid when `yaw` field is finite) --> we should init the yaw field to NAN ideally\r\n- `yawspeed` (doesn't seem to be used)\r\n- `yawspeed_valid`\r\n\r\nThere's also some other small cleanup proposal, check commits. \r\n\r\n### Changelog Entry\r\nFor release notes:\r\n```\r\nBugfix: FlightTaskAuto: disable wather vane if position setpoint contains yaw setpoint.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\n\r\n\r\n### Test coverage\r\nSITL tested for MC and VTOL. \r\nMC test:\r\n- Start the windy gazebo environment: `make px4_sitl gazebo_iris__windy`\r\n- Enable parameter `WV_EN`\r\n- Takeoff and RTL --> on current main it is stuck, doesn't RTL. With the fix here sets the yaw to the home_position.yaw, disables weather vane because the yaw field is finite, aligns yaw and descends. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Context\r\nWe should remove the yaw field of the Takeoff mission item in QGC, it has no effect (already previously to this PR).  Conceptionally I don't see the need of a yaw attribute to a MC takeoff, and wouldn't know what to expect (yaw once takeoff altitude achieved? Or already when climbing?)\r\n![image](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/assets/26798987/971572b0-f998-42fd-9547-192d3e4d8b69)\r\n\r\n",

I did have one thought regarding this solution:\r\n\r\nIf weather vane is disabled when a finite yaw setpoint is given, it will always be disabled during RTL, as there is currently always a yaw setpoint given. This may be a problem in the case of an asymetric airframe or a vehicle with a lifting surface, where it may be desirable to point into the direction of the wind the entire time. A parameter to not provide a yaw setpoint (enable weather vane) during RTL might be useful in some use cases. Hope this makes sence.",

Currently, the geofence update only checks the origin and the current position associated with the geofence, and I've added a check for mission waypoints to make the check on upload more complete.The problem is related to the state machine and asynchronous message reading in geofence.cpp.The checkMissionAgainstGeofence() is written in the mission and the geofence is still being read when the mission has finished uploading and checking.\r\n \r\n![%`%3Z`6)VGYLVSF_)N0L{BT](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/assets/151698793/38b3fe89-4ed8-47d7-8822-c5254984f679)\r\n\r\nFixes #{#22362}\r\nIn this bug issue , @czbxzm said ,\"1.

Your solution runs it drectly on upload which is preferable, but then you should reflect this evaluation in the mission result uorb topic as its done here https://github.com/Drone-Lab/PX4-Autopilot/blob/5490f8913bd26ac04d59908271ce9c5e6a1bd414/src/modules/navigator/mission_base.cpp#L702-L707 such that it is not run again by the mission feasibility checker. The problem is then, that if e.g. the home position is changed, it is still not run again, up until the mission is started. Also now, it is checked once the geofence is uploaded and once the mission is uploaded, which means if you upload a new mission with new geofence, it is evaluated once on outdated data, depending which one is uploaded first.\r\n\r\nI also already have though about how to do the checking properly, but the above problem makes it difficult. i think that QGC always send the mission, geofence, and rally points, irrespective of what you have actually changed. But with mavlink in general you should be able to send only what you actually have changed. Also if you change both and upload them, you would preferably run the check only once after both are uploaded, else you would do the evaluation on outdated data. But there is currently no way of knowing if another upload is pending except maybe waiting for a short amount of time and checking if another mission upload is in progress. Maybe there is also something mission in MAVLINK itself to solve this.\r\n\r\n",

The mission feasibility checker makes the opposite, it defines the mission as invalid and wont let you execute the mission. So what i meant with 'reflect' is if the geofence is violated, you should define the mission as invalid as well. So with your approach you would now get the warning in QGC but you could execute the mission and it would fly out of the geofence, if i'm understanding this correctly.

When the ground control station upload mission or geofence to the drone.In geofence.cpp, there is a state machine designed to read geofence data from ourb and load it onto the drone, as illustrated in the following picture.\r\n   <p align=\"center\">\r\n     <img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/151698793/294857321-53c6d894-448a-4130-85ae-30ab7e12e171.png\" width=\"622\" />\r\n   </p>\r\n   This functionality is called within a while(1) loop in navigator_main.cpp.\r\n\r\n   https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/cf840ff3731d8bebf65e79bd8c9c7bbd8d29d404/src/modules/navigator/navigator_main.cpp#L893  \r\nThe read and load operations within it utilize **asynchronous** reading, ensuring that they do not block the function loop.\r\nhttps://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/cf840ff3731d8bebf65e79bd8c9c7bbd8d29d404/src/modules/navigator/geofence.cpp#L111-L112\r\nhttps://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/cf840ff3731d8bebf65e79bd8c9c7bbd8d29d404/src/modules/navigator/geofence.cpp#L155-L163\r\n \r\n2. When the ground control station upload mission or geofence to the drone.In mission_feasibility_checker.cpp, **synchronous** reading is employed to retrieve updates for the mission, and to check for potential conflicts between the mission and geofence.\r\nhttps://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/20129e63facab129ad31fa693d1397e7458afaa4/src/modules/navigator/mission_feasibility_checker.cpp#L122-L123\r\nThis functionality is called within a while(1) loop in navigator_main.cpp too.\r\nhttps://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/20129e63facab129ad31fa693d1397e7458afaa4/src/modules/navigator/navigator_main.cpp#L873-L877\r\n\r\n3. This is the cause of the issue. When on the ground control station, both the geofence and mission are updated simultaneously. The geofence undergoes multiple state transitions through the state machine (with each state transition requiring the execution of a while(1) loop), and it is only after asynchronous reading that the geofence data can be loaded for the mission_feasibility_checker to examine.\r\nTherefore, when the mission_feasibility_checker utilizes synchronous reading to obtain mission data, the geofence data involved in the check has not yet been updated. Consequently, the check is performed with outdated geofence data, resulting in the failure of the checker.",

I know that this function is executed as soon as a mission is uploaded, and thus it could be that a geofence upload is in progress and the mission is not checked with the right geofence, which would result in a wrong evaluation. However, it is checked again before the mission is executed and a geofence violation is caught at that time (though you don't have immediate feedback in QGC). Also to not have a data race by writing and reading to the fence on the same time, there is another PR to add double geofence storage here: https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/pull/22533. I think the way to go would be to decouple the mission feasibility checker from the mission and run the checks if the home position, geofence, or mission changed, and there is no mavlink mission upload in progress. As a short term fix i would suggest changing the order in which QGC is uploading the mission and make sure that the geofence are uploaded before the mission is uploaded.

Currently, the geofence update only checks the origin and the current position associated with the geofence, and I've added a check for mission waypoints to make the check on upload more complete.The problem is related to the state machine and asynchronous message reading in geofence.cpp.The checkMissionAgainstGeofence() is written in the mission and the geofence is still being read when the mission has finished uploading and checking.\r\n \r\n![%`%3Z`6)VGYLVSF_)N0L{BT](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/assets/151698793/38b3fe89-4ed8-47d7-8822-c5254984f679)\r\n\r\n2. Regarding the issue of being unable to perform geofence breach checks for the home point using VEHICLE_CMD_DO_SET_HOME in commander.cpp due to geofence not being available in the navigator, the following solution is proposed:**When the drone switches to RTL mode, check whether the home point triggers a geofence breach.**\r\nHowever, at present, we only return the result and have successfully tested it. We have not yet implemented handling for the detected issues and event notifications because there may be some irregularities or issues in the code. We would appreciate your feedback on this matter.\r\n\r\nFixes #{#22362}\r\nIn this bug issue , @czbxzm said ,\"1. When swapping the order, uploading the mission waypoint routes first and then plotting the no-fly zones does not trigger any checks, even if there is an overlap between the two;\"Actually this check triggers, but requires a second click on upload.(in the version reporting this bug issue)\r\n\r\n#｛#22373｝\r\nIn this bug issue, @BladeY1 said,\"In SITL simulation, we observed that the Home point can be arbitrarily set by the operator. Since Return to Launch (RTL) navigates the drone back to the Home point, inadvertent placement of the Home point within a no-fly zone can result in the drone breaching no-fly zone checks or entering the restricted area when the operator manually selects RTL. We validated this behavior using a drone equipped with PX4 flight control. It indeed demonstrated the ability to enter a no-fly zone through the aforementioned actions.We believe that operators typically intend to avoid their drones entering no-fly zones to prevent potential damage or safety incidents. No-fly zones, often manually designated by operators, are crucial in areas like airports, amusement parks with high-altitude ride systems, or locations with dense obstacles such as forests, lakes, and clusters of buildings.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\n1. I've added a check for mission waypoints when update geofence.\r\n \r\n![95$0I@SC~0)3RA G`Q2XMCR](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/assets/151698793/d96db40e-0b0e-4061-9a9c-358a5bde2268)\r\n\r\n2. When the drone switches to RTL mode, check whether the home point triggers a geofence breach.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Test coverage\r\n\r\n test on jmavsim/gz_x500 and QGC\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Call it on entering RTL and Land flight modes, as well as when in a mission and the next item is Land, or on pausing a mission.\r\n\r\n### Changelog Entry\r\nFor release notes:\r\n```\r\nFeature: set gimbal to neutral (horizontal) in Landing scenarios and on pausing a Mission\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Test coverage\r\nSITL tested. \r\n",

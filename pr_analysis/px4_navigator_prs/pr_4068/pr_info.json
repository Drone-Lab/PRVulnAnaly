Downstream logic in pos_control and commander successfully ignore position data that is applied in the setpoint message. Tested in gazebo for multi-rotors.\n",

Descend nav state provides the control mechanism that I desired, and I piped an RC channel to a new failsafe main state to trigger the Descend.\n",

    "body": "Once sent from QGC to pixhawk, the fixed-wing landing pattern coordinates are again converted to local distances for feasibility checks, where small floating point errors can cause a rejection -- and the need to modify and resend the waypoints (somewhat tedious on the field). This PR simply adds a small tolerance to the check condition to avoid this.\n\n(also open to recommendations on the value of this tolerance, I just put 1m for now)\n\nPartially addresses #9472.",

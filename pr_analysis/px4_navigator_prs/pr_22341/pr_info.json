For multicopter and VTOL in RW mode, we want the system to directly fly to the home or RTL destination without using approaches.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n- Only use approaches when it is reported that the system is a vtol and in fixed wing mode.\r\n\r\n### Changelog Entry\r\nFor release notes:\r\n```\r\nBugfix Only use RTL approaches for vtols in fixed wing mode\r\n```\r\n### Test coverage\r\n",
